# @lumen/web-components

Web Components implementation of Lumen's component specifications, built with
[Lit](https://lit.dev). This is the Phase 13 (`docs/roadmap.md`) proof of
concept validating that the framework-agnostic contract in
`docs/component-specifications.md` can be implemented outside React — it
ships `<lumen-button>`, `<lumen-split-button>`, `<lumen-filter-chip>`,
`<lumen-choice-chip>`, and `<lumen-ai-button>`, matching `@lumen/ui`'s
2026-07-14 Figma sync (see `docs/changelog.md` `[Unreleased]`).

## Why Web Components first

Custom elements are natively consumable from Angular and Vue (and plain
HTML/JS), so this package doubles as groundwork for those future framework
packages rather than a one-off. See `docs/component-architecture.md` §0 for
the full layer diagram.

## Usage

```html
<script type="module">
  import "@lumen/web-components";
</script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@lumen/tokens/css" />

<lumen-button variant="primary">Save changes</lumen-button>
```

Importing the package root registers every custom element it exports as a
side effect (`sideEffects: true` in `package.json`). A per-component subpath
export (e.g. `@lumen/web-components/button`) can be added if bundle size
ever becomes a concern.

Icon slots use named `<slot>`s instead of React's `iconStart`/`iconEnd` node
props:

```html
<lumen-button>
  <span slot="icon-start">…</span>
  Save changes
  <span slot="icon-end">…</span>
</lumen-button>
```

`<lumen-button>` requires `@lumen/tokens/css` to be loaded on the page —
its styles reference the same `--color-*`/`--spacing-*`/`--radius-*` custom
properties as `@lumen/ui`, not a duplicated value set. CSS custom properties
inherit through the shadow DOM boundary, so no extra wiring is needed.

## Property contract

### `<lumen-button>`

| Property (attribute) | Type                                                                | Default   | Notes                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `variant`            | `primary \| accent \| secondary \| outline \| ghost \| destructive` | `primary` | Final collection from Figma node `1027:3733`.           |
| `size`               | `sm \| md \| lg \| xl`                                              | `md`      | 30px, 34px, 38px, and 42px from Figma node `1034:4459`. |
| `disabled`           | boolean                                                             | `false`   |                                                         |

`disabled` sets `aria-disabled` and prevents the click from reaching
listeners, matching `@lumen/ui`'s `Button` — native `disabled` is
intentionally not used, for the same keyboard-reachability reason documented
on the React component.

### `<lumen-split-button>`

Mirrors `SplitButton.tsx` (`packages/ui/src/composite/SplitButton.tsx`).
Renders two real `<button>`s in its shadow root, so a plain `click` event
can't distinguish which one fired once retargeted at the host — it
dispatches `lumen-main-click` and `lumen-dropdown-click` custom events
instead (`event.detail` carries the original `MouseEvent`).

| Property (attribute) | Type                                        | Default          | Notes                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `variant`            | `primary \| raised \| secondary \| outline` | `primary`        |                                                                                               |
| `size`               | `sm \| md \| lg`                            | `lg`             |                                                                                               |
| `pill`               | boolean                                     | `false`          |                                                                                               |
| `loading`            | boolean                                     | `false`          | Disables only the main segment; the dropdown stays interactive.                               |
| `disabled`           | boolean                                     | `false`          | Disables both segments.                                                                       |
| `dropdown-label`     | string                                      | `"More options"` | Accessible name for the dropdown-toggle segment. Warns in the console if left at the default. |

Leading icon uses `<span slot="icon-start">`, matching `<lumen-button>`'s
slot convention.

**Known limitation**: Figma's `sm` dropdown-toggle segment is a non-square
30px width, which isn't on the approved spacing scale
(`docs/design-tokens.md` §4) — shipped as a square 36px segment instead,
same simplification as the React component.

### `<lumen-filter-chip>` / `<lumen-choice-chip>`

Toggleable pills — Selection primitives with no React-equivalent naming
divergence (`selected`/`disabled` map directly). Only the `lg` size (36px)
is specced for either.

| Property (attribute) | Type    | Default | Notes                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selected`           | boolean | `false` | Reflected as `aria-pressed`.                                                                 |
| `disabled`           | boolean | `false` | Reflected as `aria-disabled` (not the native attribute), same reasoning as `<lumen-button>`. |

`<lumen-filter-chip>` renders a leading icon slot (`<span slot="icon">`,
default: a plus glyph) that's kept even when `selected`, plus a trailing
`<span slot="remove-icon">` (default: an X glyph) shown only when
`selected` — see `FilterChip.tsx`'s doc comment for why the leading icon
persists. `<lumen-choice-chip>` shows no icon by default and a leading
check icon only when `selected`.

### `<lumen-ai-button>`

Mirrors `AIButton.tsx` (`packages/ui/src/primitives/AIButton.tsx`).

| Property (attribute) | Type                                          | Default   | Notes                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `variant`            | `primary \| secondary \| ghost \| outline \| destructive` | `primary` | Canonical One AI Button treatments from node `760:1965`. |
| `size`               | `sm \| md \| lg \| xl`                        | `md`      | Exact 30/34/38/42px Figma size scale. |
| `icon-only`          | boolean                                       | `false`   | Requires `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.                                                                                           |
| `loading`            | boolean                                       | `false`   |                                                                                                                                       |
| `disabled`           | boolean                                       | `false`   |                                                                                                                                       |

A leading icon is always rendered — default slot content (`<span
slot="icon">`) is a sparkle glyph; override it for capability-specific
icons (Figma swaps the glyph per action, e.g. a wand for Rewrite).
The React-only capability lookup and split composition are documented in
`docs/component-specifications.md` §46.

## History: the spec discrepancy this package surfaced

Building this package originally surfaced that §5 (Button) of
`docs/component-specifications.md` — including the "Property contract"
section added when the docs were decoupled from React — didn't match what
`@lumen/ui`'s `Button.tsx` (the actual shipped, Figma-sourced
implementation) does: wrong variant names (`ghost`/`danger`/`ai` instead of
`raised`), an invented `fullWidth` property, and `leadingIcon`/`trailingIcon`
instead of the real `iconStart`/`iconEnd`. This package was built to match
the real React implementation, not the inaccurate docs.

That discrepancy has since been reconciled — `docs/component-specifications.md`
§5 and `docs/component-architecture.md` §7 now match `Button.tsx`, and by
extension match this package too. See `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 13 Findings
for the full record. The older API described in that history was subsequently
superseded by final Figma node `1027:3733`; React, Web Components, and Angular
now implement the same final contract. Kept here as history, not a live issue.

## Testing

`pnpm --filter @lumen/web-components test` runs Vitest against jsdom. Tests
assert DOM structure, reflected host attributes, and accessibility behavior
(the actual testable contract) rather than computed CSS values — jsdom
doesn't meaningfully resolve styles derived from CSS custom properties, and
those custom properties aren't loaded in the test environment regardless.

## Storybook

Not yet covered. `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 13 leaves the multi-framework
Storybook strategy (separate instance per framework package vs. one
canonical live-example framework) as an open decision; adding coverage for
one proof-of-concept component would prejudge that decision.
