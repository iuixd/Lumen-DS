# Lumen AI Design System

Lumen is the shared design language and implementation system for Lumen products. It provides design tokens, framework-agnostic component specifications, layout primitives, and reusable enterprise application patterns. React is Lumen's current framework package — see [Architecture](#architecture) below — with Angular, Vue, and Web Components planned as peers, not replacements.

## Explore the system

The deployed Storybook is the fastest way to inspect what Lumen provides and decide whether an existing component or pattern meets a product need.

[Open Lumen Storybook →](http://srikumar.design/Lumen-AI-DS/)

Use Storybook to:

- review component appearance and behavior
- explore supported props, variants, sizes, and states
- switch between Light and Dark themes
- inspect usage examples and generated JSX
- review accessibility guidance
- browse composed enterprise application patterns

Lumen does not currently define an elevation or shadow token tier because it is not present in the approved Figma foundation source. See [Figma synchronization](docs/figma-sync.md) for verified sources and provisional areas.

## Architecture

Lumen is a framework-agnostic design-system core with separate framework packages, so it does not treat any one framework's components as the source of truth:

```text
Approved Figma source
        ↓
  @lumen/tokens                  (framework-agnostic: CSS variables,
        ↓                          Tailwind preset, typed exports)
Framework-agnostic foundations
  and component specifications   (docs/component-specifications.md —
        ↓                          the component contract itself)
Framework packages
   ├── React           → @lumen/ui, @lumen/patterns      (reference implementation)
   ├── Web Components  → @lumen/web-components            (Lit custom elements)
   ├── Angular         → @lumen/angular                    (standalone components, Angular 20 LTS)
   └── Vue             → not yet built
        ↓
Product applications

Tokens + framework packages → Storybook (React only; Web Components and Angular not yet covered)
```

`@lumen/ui` and `@lumen/patterns` are Lumen's reference implementation, not the definition of a Lumen component — `docs/component-specifications.md` is. The final standard Button contract is synchronized across React, Web Components, and Angular from Figma node `1027:3733`; see [docs/component-specifications.md](docs/component-specifications.md) §5 and [docs/figma-sync.md](docs/figma-sync.md). See [docs/component-architecture.md](docs/component-architecture.md) §0 for the full layer diagram and rationale.

The canonical design foundation is **Lumen AI Design System**, page **Design Tokens**. Source identifiers and the authority hierarchy are maintained in [docs/figma-source.md](docs/figma-source.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22
- pnpm 11.11.0, selected through Corepack
- React 18 or later when consuming `@lumen/ui` or `@lumen/patterns`

Confirm the repository package-manager version:

```bash
corepack pnpm --version
```

The result must be `11.11.0`. Avoid using a globally installed incompatible pnpm version.

Every root script that runs a nested `pnpm --filter`/`pnpm dlx` command (including
`create:react`) invokes that nested call through `corepack` explicitly, so it resolves
the pinned `11.11.0` regardless of what pnpm install, if any, is also on `PATH` —
running any root script as `corepack pnpm <script>` is always safe.

### If `corepack pnpm --version` reports the wrong version

Corepack auto-updates its own cached "known good" release for a package-manager major
line by default. If that cache has moved ahead of this repository's exact pin, `corepack
pnpm` can resolve the newer cached version instead of `11.11.0`, and pnpm refuses to
continue with an error like:

```text
This project is configured to use 11.11.0 of pnpm. Your current pnpm is v11.12.0.
Corepack invoked pnpm with this version, and pnpm does not switch versions when
running under corepack.
```

This is a local Corepack resolution issue, not a problem with the repository's
configuration. Try the following, in order, re-running `corepack pnpm --version` after
each until it reports `11.11.0`:

1. Fetch and install the exact pinned version for local use:

   ```bash
   corepack install
   ```

2. If that alone doesn't change what `corepack pnpm --version` reports, Corepack's
   default "always prefer the latest known release" behavior may be overriding the
   project pin. Disable it for the invocation:

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $env:COREPACK_DEFAULT_TO_LATEST = "0"
   corepack pnpm --version
   ```

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   COREPACK_DEFAULT_TO_LATEST=0 corepack pnpm --version
   ```

If neither step resolves it, this is environment-specific rather than a known,
documented failure mode — open an issue with the output of `corepack --version`,
`corepack pnpm --version`, and (on Windows) `Get-Command pnpm -All` so the root cause
can be tracked down for that environment.

## Quick start

Clone the repository and enter its root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iuixd/Lumen-AI-DS.git
cd Lumen-AI-DS
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run the repository quality checks:

```bash
corepack pnpm run lint
corepack pnpm run typecheck
corepack pnpm run test
corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/tokens build
corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/storybook build-storybook
```

`typecheck` and `test` are scoped to `./packages/**` (not a blanket recursive run) so that
generated apps under `apps/*` — see [Create a React application](#create-a-react-application)
below — never get silently picked up by the repository's own root commands.

Start Storybook locally:

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/storybook storybook
```

Open `http://localhost:6006/?path=/docs/introduction--docs`.

## Use Lumen in a product application

Packages are currently consumed as Git dependencies rather than published to a package registry. Pin product applications to an approved tag or commit SHA instead of tracking `main` in production. See [versioning and releases](docs/versioning-and-releases.md) for the current release mechanics.

```jsonc
// product-app/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@lumen/tokens": "github:iuixd/Lumen-AI-DS#<tag-or-commit>&path:packages/tokens",
    "@lumen/ui": "github:iuixd/Lumen-AI-DS#<tag-or-commit>&path:packages/ui",
    "@lumen/patterns": "github:iuixd/Lumen-AI-DS#<tag-or-commit>&path:packages/patterns"
  }
}
```

`@lumen/ui` and `@lumen/patterns` currently ship as TypeScript source. Configure the product bundler to transpile them as workspace code. For example, a Next.js application should include:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  transpilePackages: ["@lumen/ui", "@lumen/patterns"]
};
```

Import public components, patterns, and token CSS:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, DataTable } from "@lumen/ui";
import { CrudListPage } from "@lumen/patterns";
import "@lumen/tokens/css";
```

Review the [usage guide](docs/usage-guidelines.md) before integrating themes or extending components.

## Create a React application

For developing a product application and the design system together in this monorepo, use the
**pnpm workspace integration model** instead: a generated app lives under `apps/<name>` as a real
member of this repository's pnpm workspace, consuming `@lumen/tokens`, `@lumen/ui`, and (optionally)
`@lumen/patterns` as `workspace:*` dependencies — no Git-dependency pinning, no publish step.

### Quick start

```bash
corepack pnpm install
corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/create-app build
corepack pnpm create:react
```

Answer the three prompts — project name (default `lumen-ai-saas`), whether to include
`@lumen/patterns`, and whether to install dependencies now — then run the generated app:

```bash
cd apps/<name>
corepack pnpm dev
```

### What you get

- The app is created under `apps/<name>` — never committed by default; generate a throwaway app
  locally whenever you need one.
- It uses local `workspace:*` dependencies, linked via pnpm symlinks, not copied.
- Changes to any package under `packages/` (tokens, ui, patterns) are available in the generated
  app immediately — no build or reinstall step.
- Installation is always managed from the repository root, even when prompted from inside the
  generated app's directory.
- This setup is intended for developing the product and the design system together, side by side,
  in one repository — for consuming Lumen from a separate product repository, see
  [Use Lumen in a product application](#use-lumen-in-a-product-application) above instead.

<details>
<summary>Non-interactive / scripted usage</summary>

Skip the prompts with flags, e.g. for CI or scripting:

```bash
corepack pnpm create:react -- --name my-app --patterns --no-install
```

</details>

## Design and Figma workflow

Figma is the canonical design source for approved foundations and components. Code changes sourced from Figma must follow the scope recorded under `[Unreleased]` in [docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md).

Before changing tokens or components:

1. Confirm the exact source in [docs/figma-source.md](docs/figma-source.md).
2. Review known drift and provisional areas in [docs/figma-sync.md](docs/figma-sync.md).
3. Reuse or extend an existing component before proposing a new one.
4. Validate the result in Storybook and against the accessibility baseline.

## Accessibility and quality

Lumen targets the WCAG 2.1 AA baseline documented in [docs/accessibility.md](docs/accessibility.md). Components must be keyboard-operable, screen-reader compatible, token-driven, and represented in Storybook.

Pull requests are expected to pass:

- lint and TypeScript validation
- unit and interaction tests
- token and package builds
- production Storybook build
- affected accessibility checks
- Figma and visual review when the change is design-sourced

See the [quality checklist](docs/quality-checklist.md) for the complete release gate.

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before changing tokens, components, patterns, or Storybook. Every component change must include its typed API, semantic-token styling, accessibility behavior, tests, Storybook documentation, and a Changeset when a published package is affected.

Use one logical change per pull request. Do not silently patch Figma drift or introduce a duplicate component.

## Releases and migration

Changesets record package release impact. The release workflow creates or updates a **Version Packages** pull request; merging that pull request updates versions and package changelogs. Product applications then adopt an approved tag or commit deliberately.
