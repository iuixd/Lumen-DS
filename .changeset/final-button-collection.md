Replace the legacy standard Button collections with the final Figma collection from node `1027:3733`. React, Web Components, Angular, and Storybook now share six variants (`primary`, `accent`, `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`, and `destructive`) and exact light/dark Default, Hover, Focused, and Disabled tokens, including the corrected mode-specific Hover surfaces, foregrounds, and borders for all six variants. Remove the former `raised`/`tertiary`/`link` variants and standard Button status, pill, icon-only, and loading APIs; migrate `tertiary` usage to `ghost` and navigation to the semantic `TextLink` component. The standard `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` Button sizes remain available.
