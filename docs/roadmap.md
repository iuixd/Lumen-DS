# 1. Vision

Lumen will become an enterprise-grade, AI-first design system that enables product teams and AI coding agents to build consistent, accessible, scalable SaaS applications from a shared Figma and code foundation.

The system should support:

- large-scale enterprise products
- AI-assisted workflows
- Light and Dark themes
- responsive web applications
- compact and comfortable density
- accessibility by default
- consistent Figma-to-code delivery
- reusable Storybook documentation
- incremental releases without full regeneration
- reliable use by Claude Code and development teams

---

# 2. Strategic outcomes

The roadmap targets six outcomes.

## 2.1 Single source of truth

Figma, token exports, code, Storybook, and documentation remain synchronized.

## 2.2 Enterprise scalability

The system supports complex workflows, large datasets, permissions, review states, and multi-step tasks.

## 2.3 Accessibility by default

Stable foundations and components meet WCAG 2.2 AA.

## 2.4 AI-first interaction patterns

Lumen provides trusted patterns for generation, review, evidence, confidence, correction, and human control.

## 2.5 Developer adoption

Teams can discover, install, understand, and implement Lumen components efficiently.

## 2.6 Controlled evolution

Changes are versioned, reviewed, tested, documented, and released incrementally.

---

# 3. Current baseline

The supplied Figma Design Tokens source currently documents:

```text
01 Colors
02 Typography
03 Scale
04 Spacing
05 Radius
```

Verified foundation values include:

- visible typography sizes and line heights
- spacing tokens from 0 to 128px
- radius tokens from 0px to pill
- documented color and scale sections

Current supporting documentation includes:

```text
figma-source.md
design-tokens.md
component-architecture.md
component-specifications.md
accessibility.md
storybook-guidelines.md
development-guidelines.md
quality-checklist.md
design-review.md
release-process.md
changelog.md
roadmap.md
```

The Storybook interface has been customized for improved UX, Lumen branding, and visual consistency.

# 4. Roadmap principles

## 4.1 Foundations before breadth

Complete tokens, themes, accessibility, and component architecture before expanding the component inventory aggressively.

## 4.2 Primitives before composites

Build stable primitive components before enterprise composites and page patterns.

## 4.3 Evidence before automation

Do not automate Figma-to-code synchronization until token exports, naming, aliases, and release checks are reliable.

## 4.4 Adoption before volume

Measure component usage and developer success rather than only counting components.

## 4.5 Incremental delivery

Each phase should deliver usable value without requiring the entire system to be complete.

## 4.6 No full-system regeneration

Small updates must affect only relevant tokens, components, stories, tests, and documentation.

---

# 5. Maturity model

Use the following maturity levels.

| Level | Name          | Definition                                                                         |
| ----: | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     0 | Unstructured  | Values and components are inconsistent or undocumented                             |
|     1 | Documented    | Foundations and standards are recorded                                             |
|     2 | Tokenized     | Shared values are represented as managed tokens                                    |
|     3 | Componentized | Stable reusable components exist in Figma and code                                 |
|     4 | Governed      | Review, testing, release, and deprecation processes operate consistently           |
|     5 | Automated     | Token generation, validation, parity checks, and release workflows are automated   |
|     6 | Optimized     | Adoption, quality, performance, and AI-assisted delivery are measured and improved |

Current estimated state:

```text
Foundations: Level 1–2
Components: Level 1–2
Accessibility: Level 1
Storybook: Level 2–3
Governance: Level 1–2
Automation: Level 0–1
```

These estimates require repository and Figma library verification.

```

must be stable before broad component release.

## Component dependencies

```text
Primitives
    ↓
Composites
    ↓
Enterprise components
    ↓
Patterns
    ↓
Templates
```

## Automation dependencies

Automation requires:

# 25. Roadmap update process

When roadmap priorities change:

1. Record the reason.
2. Identify affected phases and deliverables.
3. Update owners and target periods.
4. Update dependencies.
5. Update release expectations.
6. Record the change in `changelog.md` when it affects committed delivery scope.
7. Communicate the change to design and engineering teams.

Do not silently remove committed accessibility, quality, or migration work.

---

# 26. Claude Code roadmap protocol

Before planning or implementing roadmap work, Claude Code must read:

```text
CLAUDE.md
AGENTS.md
docs/figma-source.md
docs/design-tokens.md
docs/component-architecture.md
docs/component-specifications.md
docs/accessibility.md
docs/storybook-guidelines.md
docs/development-guidelines.md
docs/quality-checklist.md
docs/design-review.md
docs/release-process.md
docs/roadmap.md
docs/changelog.md
```

## Planning pass

Claude Code must:

1. Identify the requested roadmap initiative.
2. Confirm its phase and dependencies.
3. Inspect the current repository and Storybook.
4. Identify missing prerequisites.
5. Propose the smallest executable milestone.
6. Avoid implementing unrelated roadmap items.
7. Report risks and validation requirements.

## Reusable prompt

```markdown
Read:

- `docs/figma-source.md`
- `docs/design-tokens.md`
- `docs/component-architecture.md`
- `docs/component-specifications.md`
- `docs/accessibility.md`
- `docs/storybook-guidelines.md`
- `docs/development-guidelines.md`
- `docs/quality-checklist.md`
- `docs/design-review.md`
- `docs/release-process.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`
- `docs/changelog.md`

Plan only the requested Lumen roadmap initiative.

First report:

1. current maturity
2. prerequisites
3. affected tokens
4. affected components
5. affected packages
6. Storybook impact
7. accessibility impact
8. testing requirements
9. release impact
10. smallest executable milestone

Do not implement unrelated roadmap items.
Do not regenerate the design system.
Do not infer missing Figma values.
Use component-specific Figma nodes for implementation work.
```

---

# 27. Current verification status

The Figma plugin was invoked for node `426:4395`, but `get_design_context` returned a selection-related error indicating that no layer was selected.

The roadmap is therefore grounded in:

- the supplied Figma file and node
- previously retrieved Figma metadata
- verified foundation sections
- the current Lumen documentation set
- the customized local Storybook context

The following require direct Figma Variable exports, repository inspection, or component-specific Dev Mode links before their roadmap status can be marked complete:

- exact color values and aliases
- variable collection names and modes
- font families and weights
- complete scale values
- component inventory
- component maturity
- Code Connect coverage
- token pipeline implementation
- CI validation coverage
- package release configuration
- Storybook deployment status

Do not mark roadmap deliverables complete without evidence.

---

# 28. Phase 13: Multi-framework expansion

## Objective

Support React, Angular, Vue, and future frameworks without treating any single framework's components as the source of truth. Lumen is structured as a framework-agnostic design-system core (tokens, framework-agnostic foundations, component specifications) with separate framework packages implementing that shared contract — see `docs/component-architecture.md` §0 for the full layer diagram.

## Status

```text
In progress — Web Components proof of concept shipped (Button only) 2026-07-12.
Docs/implementation discrepancy reconciled the same day (see Findings below).
Angular proof of concept (Button only) shipped 2026-07-12 as @lumen/angular,
targeting Angular 20 LTS (not latest 22 — see package README for the
TypeScript-version reason). Vue framework package not yet started.
The standard Button contract was replaced across React, Web Components, and
Angular by the final Figma collection at node 1027:3733 on 2026-07-20.

## Sequencing

This phase depends on Phases 0–8 (governance, foundations, primitive/composite libraries, Storybook) reaching a stable state in the React reference implementation first. Adding framework packages before the contract itself is stable multiplies the cost of every subsequent Figma-sourced change. The Web Components proof of concept was built ahead of that sequencing being fully satisfied, deliberately scoped to one component (Button) to keep the exception small.

## Deliverables

- [x] Decouple `docs/component-architecture.md` and `docs/component-specifications.md` from React so the component contract is framework-neutral and React is documented as the current reference implementation, not the definition.
- [x] Build one additional framework package as a proof of concept: Web Components (chosen over Angular/Vue first because custom elements are natively consumable from both, reducing the total number of adapters ultimately needed, and validate the contract without committing to one framework's idioms). Shipped as `@lumen/web-components`, Button only, built with Lit. See `packages/web-components/README.md`.
- [x] Attempt to validate that the Web Components package can implement the existing Button specification (§5 of `docs/component-specifications.md`) without requiring spec changes — **result: it could not**, because the spec itself doesn't match the real React implementation. See Findings below.
- [ ] Decide Storybook strategy for multiple frameworks (separate Storybook instance per framework package vs. one canonical live-example framework with contract-only docs for the rest). Deliberately deferred — out of scope for a one-component proof of concept.
- [ ] Update `docs/versioning-and-releases.md` so each framework package versions against a shared contract version rather than independently.
- [x] Build the Angular framework package (Button only, proof of concept). Shipped as `@lumen/angular`, standalone components, Angular 20 LTS. See `packages/angular/README.md` — including a documented JIT/Vitest testing constraint that shaped an implementation choice (classic `@Input()` decorators, not signal `input()`).
- [ ] Build the Vue framework package.
- [ ] Add a "Framework" column/section to every component specification's Code mapping once more than one framework package exists.
- [x] Reconcile `docs/component-specifications.md` §5 (Button) and `docs/component-architecture.md` §7 against the real `Button.tsx`/`Button.stories.tsx`/`Button.test.tsx` — done 2026-07-12, see Findings.

## Findings

Building the Web Components Button surfaced that `docs/component-specifications.md` §5 did not match what `@lumen/ui`'s `Button.tsx` actually ships:

- Docs listed variants `primary | secondary | tertiary | ghost | link | danger | ai`. The real component ships `primary | raised | secondary | tertiary | link` — no `ghost`/`danger`/`ai`, and has `raised` instead.
- Docs listed a `fullWidth` property that the real component doesn't implement.
- Docs named icon props `leadingIcon`/`trailingIcon`; the real component uses `iconStart`/`iconEnd`, plus undocumented `iconOnly` and `pill` modifiers.
- Docs listed sizes `sm | md | lg`; the real component also has `xs`.
- Docs listed `Selected`/`Success`/`Error` as optional states; none are implemented or in the cited Figma source.

`@lumen/web-components`'s Button was built to match the real React implementation, not the docs, since matching neither would have defeated the point of a cross-framework consistency check. `docs/component-specifications.md` §5 and `docs/component-architecture.md` §7 (which duplicated the same variant/property list) were then reconciled against `Button.tsx` directly — both now match the real, shipped, Figma-cited implementation.

This finding is historical. On 2026-07-20, final Figma node `1027:3733`
superseded the older node `475:7210` Button collection. All three framework
implementations and the authoritative specification now use the final six
variants, the 30/34/38/42px `sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl` size scale, and
Default/Hover/Focused/Disabled states.

Building `@lumen/angular` surfaced a separate, tooling-level finding (not a spec discrepancy): Angular's JIT compiler cannot recognize signal-based `input()`/`output()` fields when components are transformed by plain esbuild (what Vitest uses) instead of a real Angular/TypeScript compiler pipeline — see `packages/angular/README.md` for the full explanation and `angular/angular#54013`. The fix (classic `@Input()` decorators instead of signal inputs) kept this package's tooling as light as `@lumen/ui` and `@lumen/web-components`, avoiding a dependency on `@angular/build`/`@analogjs/vite-plugin-angular`. Apply the same check before building the Vue package: verify Vue's Vitest/testing story doesn't have an equivalent gap before assuming the same lightweight approach works there too.

## Exit criteria

- [x] at least one non-React framework package ships a component that conforms to an existing, unmodified component specification — met; both `@lumen/web-components` and `@lumen/angular` now ship a Button matching the reconciled spec
- [x] the component contract in `docs/component-specifications.md` requires no React-specific language to be understood or implemented by a new framework package, and its content matches the real shipped component
- [ ] Storybook (or its documented equivalent) covers every shipped framework package — deferred, see Deliverables
- [ ] release process versions framework packages against the shared contract without silent drift — not yet addressed

The Vue framework package may now be started against an accurate Button specification. Apply the same real-source verification (Figma node + actual component/test/story files, not assumed prior docs) to each additional component before or as it's ported to a new framework — the Button discrepancy is exactly the failure mode this phase exists to catch early. Also check Vue's Vitest testing story for an equivalent JIT/compiler gap before assuming the Angular package's approach transfers directly.

# 29. Phase 14: Product scaffolding

## Objective

Let a product application be developed alongside the design system itself, in this same repository, without the pinned-Git-dependency overhead the "Use Lumen in a product application" model requires — so day-to-day component and token changes are visible in a real consuming app immediately, with no publish, tag, or link step.

## Status

```text
Shipped 2026-07-17 as @lumen/create-app, a CLI scaffolder (pnpm create:react)
generating a React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind app under apps/<name>, wired
to @lumen/tokens, @lumen/ui, and (optionally) @lumen/patterns via workspace:*
dependencies. This phase was not planned ahead of time on this roadmap — it is
recorded here retroactively for tracking, per this document's own governance
requirement that shipped work be discoverable here.
```

## Deliverables

- [x] A non-interactive and interactive CLI (`packages/create-app`) that scaffolds a workspace-member React app under `apps/<name>`, prompting for (or accepting flags for) project name, whether to include `@lumen/patterns`, and whether to install dependencies immediately.
- [x] Generated app wired to the local `@lumen/tokens`/`@lumen/ui`/`@lumen/patterns` sources via pnpm `workspace:*` symlinks — no build or reinstall step needed to see package changes reflected.
- [x] `apps/*` added to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; root `typecheck`/`test` rescoped to `./packages/**` and `.eslintrc.cjs` updated so generated scaffolds never leak into the repository's own quality gates.
- [x] CI coverage (`.github/workflows/react-starter.yml`) proving a generated app installs, type-checks, and builds from a clean, frozen-then-workspace install — not just that the scaffolder's own unit tests pass.
- [x] `README.md` documentation of the flow ("Create a React application").
- [ ] Decide whether `@lumen/create-app` should offer a Vue or framework-agnostic template once a corresponding framework package exists (see Phase 13) — not yet addressed, no demand identified.

## Findings

`corepack pnpm <script>` does not unconditionally guarantee the pinned `11.11.0` pnpm version is what actually runs. Corepack maintains its own cached "known good release" per package-manager major line and auto-updates it by default; when that cache has moved ahead of this repository's exact pin, `corepack pnpm` can resolve the newer cached version instead, and pnpm's own corepack-invocation version guard then refuses to proceed rather than silently run the wrong version — reproduced live on 2026-07-17 (`corepack pnpm create:react` failing with "Your current pnpm is v11.12.0"). `corepack install` (fetches/installs the exact pinned version for local project use) did not resolve the reproduced case on its own; disabling Corepack's default auto-update behavior via `COREPACK_DEFAULT_TO_LATEST=0` was also required. See `README.md` Prerequisites, "If `corepack pnpm --version` reports the wrong version," for the documented remediation path.

## Exit criteria

- [x] `pnpm create:react` produces an app that installs, type-checks, and builds without manual intervention, verified both in CI and via a local end-to-end run
- [x] the generated app requires no Git-dependency pinning or publish step to consume `@lumen/tokens`/`@lumen/ui`/`@lumen/patterns`
- [x] generated scaffolds are excluded from the repository's own lint/typecheck/test runs by construction, not by convention

# 30. Phase 15: shadcn component integration

## Objective

Adopt shadcn/ui as a component *source* and behavioral-implementation layer for complex interaction patterns Lumen doesn't yet have hand-built primitives for (command palettes, sheets, dropdown menus, popovers), without shadcn ever becoming a second, competing visual theme. Lumen tokens remain the only source of truth for color, typography, spacing, radius, shadow, motion, and dark mode; shadcn/Radix supply composition, keyboard interaction, and ARIA behavior only.

## Status

```text
Started 2026-07-23. Not planned ahead of time on this roadmap — it is recorded
here retroactively for tracking, per this document's own governance
requirement that shipped work be discoverable here (same pattern as Phase 14).
First components: Command, then Accordion (neither had an existing Lumen
equivalent). See docs/shadcn-integration.md for the full governance model
and docs/changelog.md's [Unreleased] entries for the concrete token bridge
and dependency list per component.
```

## Deliverables

- [x] `packages/ui/components.json` — shadcn CLI configuration targeting this repo's actual Tailwind v3 setup and monorepo aliases (generates into `packages/ui/src`, never into an application).
- [x] `packages/ui/src/styles/shadcn-lumen-bridge.css` — a one-directional mapping from shadcn's compatibility variables onto existing Lumen semantic tokens (no invented tokens, no committed shadcn default theme values).
- [x] `Command` adopted as the first component: internal generated source kept at `packages/ui/src/components/internal`, public API re-exported from `@lumen/ui` at `packages/ui/src/components/command`.
- [x] `Accordion` adopted as the second component, same internal/public split. Its adoption also surfaced that the shadcn CLI edits `tailwind.config.cjs` directly on generation (added `darkMode: ["class"]` and hardcoded animation keyframes) — both reverted; see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` §6.
- [x] Scope expanded 2026-07-23 by direct user instruction to the entire shadcn `registry:ui` set (61 components), including ones that duplicate an existing Lumen primitive — see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` §7 for the override, naming-collision convention, and batching approach. `Alert`/`Separator`/`Skeleton`/`Progress`/`AspectRatio`/`Kbd` adopted as batch 1 (genuine gaps, no naming collisions, no non-Radix dependencies).
- [x] `Popover`/`DropdownMenu`/`Sheet`/`ScrollArea`/`HoverCard`/`Slider` adopted as batch 2. Caught a second real upstream shadcn bug (`Slider` hardcoding a single thumb regardless of value count) — see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` §5.
- [x] `Textarea`/`Toggle`/`InputOTP`/`ContextMenu`/`Breadcrumb`/`Drawer`/`Carousel`/`Item` adopted as batch 3. `Marker`/`Direction`/`Attachment` dropped (unavailable for the `new-york` registry style — see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` §7.4). First non-Radix behavioral dependencies (`vaul`, `embla-carousel-react`). Caught an unanticipated naming collision (`PageHeader`'s own `Breadcrumb` type, renamed to `PageHeaderBreadcrumb`) and three new jsdom test-environment gaps (`matchMedia`, `elementFromPoint`, `IntersectionObserver`).
- [x] `Collapsible`/`Label`/`ToggleGroup`/`NavigationMenu`/`ShadcnForm` adopted as batch 4 (the ambiguous/overlapping set). `Combobox`/`NativeSelect` unavailable for the `new-york` registry style, dropped. `Sidebar` and `Message`/`MessageScroller`/`Bubble` skipped entirely by direct user decision — judged full functional duplicates of `AppShell`/`AIPanel`, not partial overlaps. First form-state-management dependencies (`react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, `zod`) — see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` §7.5.
- [x] `ShadcnButton`/`ShadcnCard`/`ShadcnTabs`/`ShadcnTooltip`/`ShadcnSelect`/`ShadcnAvatar`/`ShadcnInput`/`ShadcnSwitch`/`ShadcnCheckbox`/`ShadcnPagination`/`ShadcnButtonGroup` (11 `Shadcn`-prefixed) plus `Dialog`/`RadioGroup`/`Table` (3 plain, no collision) adopted as batch 5 — completes the name-colliding-duplicates phase. Caught `ButtonGroup` was missed from the original "no collision" list (Lumen already has one) by re-verifying against the actual export surface, not memory — see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` §7.6.
- [ ] Remaining: `Calendar`/`Chart` (heaviest dependencies — a date library, Recharts) — not yet started.
- [ ] Ambiguous/overlapping components, each with documented reasoning: `Collapsible` (vs. `Accordion`), `Combobox`, `ToggleGroup` (vs. `SegmentedControl`), `Form` (brings in `react-hook-form`/`zod`), `NativeSelect`, `NavigationMenu`/`Sidebar` (vs. `AppShell`), `Message`/`MessageScroller`/`Bubble` (vs. `AIPanel`) — not yet started.
- [ ] Name-colliding duplicates, exported as `ShadcnButton`/`ShadcnCard`/`ShadcnTabs`/`ShadcnTooltip`/`ShadcnSelect`/`ShadcnAvatar`/`ShadcnInput`/`ShadcnSwitch`/`ShadcnCheckbox`/`ShadcnPagination` per the §7.1 convention, plus non-colliding duplicates (`Dialog`, `RadioGroup`, `Table`, `ButtonGroup`) — not yet started.
- [ ] `Calendar` and `Chart` — each brings in a substantial new third-party dependency beyond Radix (a date library, Recharts) and needs its own scoped check before adoption — not yet started.
- [ ] React Starter (`@lumen/create-app`) template updated with a compatible `components.json` so generated apps can adopt further shadcn-sourced components the same way — not yet started.
- [ ] CI check preventing known default shadcn theme values from being committed — not yet started.

## Findings

Lumen's `Modal.tsx` already carried a comment anticipating a future Radix dependency ("swap in Radix Dialog if strict focus trapping / portal behavior is required") — this phase is the first place that swap actually happens, scoped to `Command`'s underlying dialog behavior. The repository's color tokens resolve to full hex values, not bare HSL channels, which rules out shadcn's default `hsl(var(--x))` Tailwind wiring; the bridge and Tailwind preset use `var(--x)` directly instead. Lumen has no general-purpose "secondary/muted/accent" surface tokens outside component-specific ones (button, badge) — the bridge reuses the closest existing named token per role rather than inventing a new tier; see `docs/shadcn-integration.md` for which mappings are exact reuses versus judgment calls.

## Exit criteria

- [ ] At least one shadcn-sourced component ships with full Storybook coverage, tests, and passing typecheck/build, importable only via `@lumen/ui`
- [ ] No shadcn default theme values present anywhere in committed CSS
- [ ] Dark mode for every adopted component follows Lumen's existing `data-theme` mechanism with no second theme system introduced
- [ ] `docs/shadcn-integration.md` documents the rules clearly enough that a future component adoption doesn't require re-deriving this phase's decisions
