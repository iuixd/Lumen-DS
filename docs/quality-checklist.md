# 1. Purpose

Use this checklist before:

- approving a Figma foundation or component
- merging a pull request
- publishing Storybook
- releasing token or component packages
- marking a component Stable
- synchronizing Figma and code
- completing a Claude Code update

This checklist is a release gate, not a documentation exercise.

Critical or high-severity failures must block release.

---

# 2. Quality status

Use one of these statuses:

```text
Not Reviewed
In Review
Blocked
Approved with Conditions
Approved
Released
```

## Severity

| Severity | Meaning | Release impact |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | Core task, safety, accessibility, or architecture failure | Blocks release |
| High | Major defect with no reasonable workaround | Blocks release |
| Medium | Material issue with an available workaround | Requires owner and target date |
| Low | Minor inconsistency or documentation issue | May be deferred |
| Observation | Improvement opportunity | Does not block release |

# 22. Claude Code quality protocol

Before reviewing or modifying Lumen, Claude Code must read:

```text
AGENTS.md
docs/figma-source.md
docs/design-tokens.md
docs/component-architecture.md
docs/component-specifications.md
docs/accessibility.md
docs/storybook-guidelines.md
docs/development-guidelines.md
docs/quality-checklist.md
docs/changelog.md
```

Then:

1. Read the current `[Unreleased]` scope.
2. Identify affected Figma nodes, tokens, components, stories, and tests.
3. Inspect the existing implementation before changing it.
4. Apply only the approved delta.
5. Run available checks.
6. Review the local Storybook.
7. Complete only applicable checklist sections.
8. Report failures by severity.
9. Do not mark checks as passed without evidence.
10. Never regenerate or refactor unrelated parts of the design system.

## Reusable Claude Code audit prompt

```markdown
Read:

- `docs/figma-source.md`
- `docs/design-tokens.md`
- `docs/component-architecture.md`
- `docs/component-specifications.md`
- `docs/accessibility.md`
- `docs/storybook-guidelines.md`
- `docs/development-guidelines.md`
- `docs/quality-checklist.md`
- `docs/changelog.md`

Audit only the changes listed under `[Unreleased]`.

Use the approved Figma node, token exports, current source, and local Storybook as evidence.

Do not modify files during the first audit pass.

Report:

1. passed checks
2. failed checks
3. severity of each failure
4. affected files and components
5. Figma-to-code differences
6. accessibility risks
7. missing tests
8. recommended minimal fixes

After the audit, apply only approved fixes.
Do not regenerate the design system.
Do not refactor unrelated files.
Do not mark a check as passed without evidence.

Run the available lint, type-check, test, build, Storybook-build, accessibility, and visual-regression commands.

Then provide a final release recommendation:

- Approved
- Approved with Conditions
- Blocked
```

---

# 23. Final release decision

Use this summary:

```markdown
## Final quality decision

- Status:
- Version:
- Approved by:
- Date:
- Critical issues:
- High issues:
- Medium issues:
- Low issues:
- Conditional approvals:
- Deferred items:
- Storybook verified:
- Figma parity verified:
- Accessibility verified:
- Build verified:
- Release recommendation:
```

A release can be marked **Approved** only when:

- all Critical and High issues are resolved
- required validation passes
- Figma-to-code parity is acceptable
- accessibility requirements pass
- Storybook is current
- documentation is current
- changelog and versioning are complete

---

# 24. Current verification note

The Figma connector was invoked for node `426:4395`, but the design-context request returned a selection-related error stating that no layer was selected.

The quality checklist is therefore grounded in:

- the known Lumen Design Tokens source structure
- the verified foundation categories
- previously retrieved Figma metadata
- the documented Lumen development and accessibility standards

The following must still be verified through direct Figma Variable exports or component-specific Dev Mode nodes:

- exact color values and aliases
- variable collections and modes
- font families and weights
- focus-token values
- component inventory
- component properties
- component-specific dimensions
- Code Connect mappings
- complete Light and Dark semantic mappings

Do not mark these checks as passed without direct evidence.
