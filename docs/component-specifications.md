## Scope

The referenced Figma node documents the Lumen foundations:

- Colors
- Typography
- Scale
- Spacing
- Radius

It does not expose the complete component inventory or all component-set properties. Therefore, this document defines the required specification contract and approved baseline components. Exact variant values, node IDs, properties, and token aliases must be synchronized from each component-specific Figma URL before implementation.

---

# 1. Specification authority

Use the following authority order:

```text
Published Figma component
    ↓
Approved component-specific Dev Mode node
    ↓
Component token definitions
    ↓
This specification                       (framework-neutral contract)
    ↓
Framework package implementation          (React today; Angular, Vue, and
    ↓                                       Web Components are future peers,
    ↓                                       not replacements)
Storybook and tests
```

This specification is the component contract every framework package implements — it does not belong to React or any other single framework. React is currently the only shipped framework package (`@lumen/ui`, `@lumen/patterns`), so today it is also the only place this specification is realized in code; that is a statement about what has been built, not about which layer is authoritative. See `docs/component-architecture.md` §0 for the full layer diagram.

When information conflicts:

1. Approved and published Figma components define visual anatomy and supported variants.
2. Exported token files define exact machine-readable values.
3. This document defines behavior, governance, accessibility, and documentation requirements — independent of framework.
4. `changelog.md` defines the authorized update scope.
5. A framework package's implementation must conform to this specification; if a package's real behavior differs, the package is wrong, not the spec.
6. Claude Code must report ambiguity instead of inventing behavior or values.

---

# 2. Required component specification structure

Every production component must include the following sections.

```markdown
# Component name

## Status
Draft | Experimental | Beta | Stable | Deprecated

## Figma source
Component URL, node ID, component-set name, and last synchronization date.

## Purpose
What the component enables.

## When to use
Approved use cases.

## When not to use
Misuse cases and recommended alternatives.

## Anatomy
Named component regions.

## Variants
Supported semantic variants.

## Sizes
Supported size options.

## States
Supported interaction and validation states.

## Properties
Figma properties and the framework-neutral property contract (canonical name, type, and meaning — independent of any single framework's API syntax).

## Behavior
Interaction rules, state transitions, layout, and content behavior.

## Content
Labels, descriptions, truncation, localization, and tone.

## Tokens
Semantic and component token dependencies.

## Accessibility
Semantics, keyboard interaction, focus, announcements, and contrast.

## Responsive behavior
Resizing, wrapping, density, and breakpoint expectations.

## Storybook
Required stories, controls, and documentation.

## Testing
Unit, accessibility, visual, and integration coverage.

## Code mapping
One entry per shipped framework package: export or custom-element name, source path, and Code Connect mapping. React is the only shipped framework package today.

## Change history
Component-specific additions, changes, and deprecations.
```

# 3. Cross-component standards

## 3.1 Naming

Use semantic names.

Recommended:

```text
Primary
Secondary
Tertiary
Ghost
Danger
Success
Warning
Info
```

Avoid implementation names:

```text
Blue
Gray
Outlined Blue
Filled Dark
```

Use these standard state names:

```text
Default
Hover
Pressed
Focus
Disabled
Loading
Selected
Checked
Indeterminate
Expanded
Read Only
Invalid
Success
Warning
Error
```

## 3.2 Sizes

Use the shared size vocabulary:

```text
Sm
Md
Lg
```

Add `Xs` or `Xl` only after design-system review.

## 3.3 Density

Enterprise components may support:

```text
Comfortable
Compact
```

Density must resolve through approved tokens and must not be implemented using arbitrary overrides.

## 3.4 Token usage

All components must use:

- semantic color tokens
- component-specific color tokens where necessary
- spacing tokens
- radius tokens
- typography styles
- elevation tokens
- motion tokens
- focus tokens

Do not hardcode token-backed values.

## 3.5 Layout

Production components should use Figma Auto Layout and equivalent flexible layout behavior in code.

Validate:

- Hug, Fill, and Fixed behavior
- minimum and maximum dimensions
- long text
- wrapping
- localization expansion
- icon alignment
- nested spacing
- responsive resizing

## 3.6 Accessibility

All stable components must meet WCAG 2.2 AA.

Every component specification must identify:

```text
Role
Accessible name
Keyboard interaction
Focus behavior
ARIA attributes
Announcements
Contrast
Touch target
Reduced-motion behavior
Known constraints
```

---

# 4. Foundation-to-component mapping

The current Figma source provides the following foundations.

## Typography

| Role | Size | Line height |
|---|---:|---:|
| Heading H1 | 60px | 72px |
| Heading H2 | 50px | 60px |
| Heading H3 | 40px | 50px |
| Heading H4 | 32px | 42px |
| Heading H5 | 24px | 32px |
| Heading H6 | 20px | 28px |
| Body Lg | 20px | 32px |
| Body Md | 16px | 26px |
| Body Sm | 14px | 22px |
| Body Xs | 12px | 20px |
| Label Lg | 14px | 20px |
| Label Md | 12px | 18px |
| Label Sm | 11px | 16px |
| Overline | 11px | 16px |
| Caption | 11px | 18px |
| Code Md | 14px | 22px |
| Code Sm | 12px | 20px |

## Spacing

```text
0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,
40, 48, 56, 64, 80, 96, 128
```

## Radius

```text
None = 0px
Xs = 2px
Sm = 4px
Md = 6px
Lg = 8px
Xl = 12px
2xl = 16px
3xl = 24px
Full = pill / 9999px
```

Exact color values, aliases, modes, font families, font weights, letter spacing, and general scale values must come from Figma Variables or component-specific Dev Mode nodes.

# 5. Button

## Status

Baseline specification, reconciled against the shipped implementation
(`packages/ui/src/primitives/Button.tsx`, Lumen-DS-2027 node `475:7210`,
formerly `466:4365`) on 2026-07-12 — see `docs/roadmap.md` Phase 13
Findings for what was wrong before this reconciliation and why. Updated
2026-07-14 to add the `status` (Success/Warning/Error) property — see
`docs/changelog.md` `[Unreleased]`.

## Purpose

Buttons trigger immediate actions such as submitting data, creating records, confirming decisions, opening workflows, or invoking AI-assisted operations.

## When to use

Use a Button when:

- the user initiates an action
- the outcome occurs in the current product context
- a form is submitted
- a workflow advances
- a confirmation or destructive action is required
- an AI-assisted operation is explicitly initiated

## When not to use

Do not use a Button for:

- navigation to another location when a Link is more appropriate
- persistent on/off state when a Switch is appropriate
- selecting one option from a group
- opening passive explanatory content without a clear action
- icon-only actions without an accessible label

## Anatomy

```text
Button
├── Container
├── State layer
├── Content
│   ├── Leading icon
│   ├── Label
│   └── Trailing icon
├── Loading indicator
└── Focus ring
```

## Variants

```text
Primary
Raised
Secondary
Tertiary
Link
```

### Primary

Use for the highest-priority action in a logical region. Flat fill, no elevation.

### Raised

Same priority and coloring as Primary, with an elevation shadow that increases on hover and settles on press — use when a button needs to visually lift off a busy or low-contrast background.

### Secondary

Use for important supporting actions.

### Tertiary

Use for lower-emphasis actions that still require a visible control boundary or text action treatment.

### Link

Use when the interaction visually resembles a text action. Use a semantic link element when the action navigates.

## Modifiers

Independent of variant and size:

### Icon only

Renders a square, label-less button sized to just its icon. Figma documents this as its own "Type" (always Primary-styled, always bordered) rather than a variant; in code it's the `{ variant: "primary", iconOnly: true }` compound, and `iconOnly` also works as a general square-shape modifier on other variants. An accessible name (`aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`) is mandatory.

### Pill

Fully rounded corners instead of the default radius, independent of variant or size.

## Sizes

```text
Xs
Sm
Md
Lg
```

Each size must define:

```text
height
padding-inline
padding-block
gap
label typography
icon size
spinner size
```

Exact values must be synchronized from the Button Figma component.

## States

```text
Default
Hover
Pressed
Focus
Disabled
Loading
```

## Status (independent of State)

```text
Success
Warning
Error
```

Added 2026-07-14, sourced from the Button component-set's own State property
on node `475:7210` (Success/Error/Warning instances now exist for Primary and
Secondary at every size, confirmed via `get_design_context`). Figma models
these as three more mutually-exclusive values of the same "State" enum as
Default/Hover/.../Loading; the shipped implementation instead exposes them as
an independent `status` modifier (see Properties below) because it composes
better with the live interaction pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:active`) code
already needs — a button can be both "showing success" and momentarily
hovered, a combination Figma's model has no instance for but code must still
render sensibly. `Selected` is still not implemented or in the Figma
source — a prior version of this section speculatively listed it alongside
Success/Error and was corrected on 2026-07-12; it stays out until Figma
specs it.

## Properties

Figma properties (per the Button/Icon Button/Pill Button instances on the
Figma node cited in Status above):

```text
Variant
Size
State
Label
Icon only
Pill
Show leading icon
Leading icon
Show trailing icon
Trailing icon
```

Figma's "State" property also carries the three Status values (Success/Warning/Error) described above — the framework-neutral contract below splits them into a separate `status` property rather than folding them into `variant` or a single combined `state` enum.

A prior version of this list also included "Full width" — no such property
exists on the Figma component or the shipped implementation; removed.

Property contract (framework-neutral — every framework package exposes these, named and typed identically in spirit):

```text
variant   enum: primary | raised | secondary | tertiary | link
size      enum: xs | sm | md | lg
status    enum: success | warning | error (optional — no value means no status tint)
iconOnly  boolean
pill      boolean
loading   boolean
disabled  boolean
iconStart renderable content (icon)
iconEnd   renderable content (icon)
```

Reference implementation — React (`@lumen/ui`, `packages/ui/src/primitives/Button.tsx`):

```ts
export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: "primary" | "raised" | "secondary" | "tertiary" | "link";
  size?: "xs" | "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  status?: "success" | "warning" | "error";
  iconStart?: React.ReactNode;
  iconEnd?: React.ReactNode;
  isLoading?: boolean;
  iconOnly?: boolean;
  pill?: boolean;
}
```

React names the `loading` contract property `isLoading` — an inconsistency
with this document's own naming guidance (`docs/component-architecture.md`
§5.1: avoid unnecessary `is-` prefixes) that predates the multi-framework
work and hasn't been fixed in `Button.tsx` itself. `@lumen/web-components`'s
`<lumen-button>` uses the canonical `loading` name instead — see
`packages/web-components/README.md`.

## Behavior

- Activation occurs through pointer click, Enter, or Space.
- Loading prevents duplicate activation where appropriate.
- Loading preserves the component width.
- Disabled buttons do not receive interaction.
- Focus-visible treatment appears for keyboard navigation.
- Link-styled buttons must use semantic anchors for navigation.
- Icon-only buttons resize to a single square per size, replacing the size's normal min-width/padding box model.
- Pill applies fully-rounded corners regardless of variant or size.
- Destructive or irreversible actions should use confirmation when consequences are significant, regardless of which variant is used to present them — there is no dedicated "danger" variant today (see Variants above).

## Content

- Use concise, action-oriented labels.
- Begin with a verb where practical.
- Avoid generic labels such as “Click here.”
- Keep labels stable during loading unless the replacement clarifies progress.
- Avoid truncating critical action labels.
- Account for localization expansion.

## Tokens

Required token structure:

```text
Button/{Variant}/Background/{State}
Button/{Variant}/Text/{State}
Button/{Variant}/Icon/{State}
Button/{Variant}/Border/{State}

Button/{Size}/Height
Button/{Size}/Padding/Inline
Button/{Size}/Padding/Block
Button/{Size}/Gap
Button/{Size}/Icon/Size

Button/Radius
Button/Border/Width
Button/Focus/Ring/Width
Button/Focus/Ring/Offset
Button/Focus/Ring/Color
```

Status tint tokens (variant-agnostic, applied via `status` rather than `variant`):

```text
Color/Status/Success/Subtle   → --color-status-success-subtle
Color/Status/Success/Text     → --color-status-success-text
Color/Status/Success/Border   → --color-status-success-border
Color/Status/Warning/Subtle   → --color-status-warning-subtle
Color/Status/Warning/Text     → --color-status-warning-text
Color/Status/Warning/Border   → --color-status-warning-border
Color/Status/Error/Subtle     → --color-status-error-subtle
Color/Status/Error/Text       → --color-status-error-text
Color/Status/Error/Border     → --color-status-error-border
```

## Accessibility

- Use `<button>` for actions.
- Use `<a>` for navigation.
- Icon-only buttons require `aria-label`.
- Loading status should be announced when meaningful.
- Do not rely on color alone for disabled states.
- Focus must remain visible.
- Touch target should meet the approved minimum target size.
- Spinner animation must respect reduced-motion preferences.

## Storybook

Required stories:

```text
Overview
Variants (including Pill)
Sizes
States
With Icons
Icon Only
Loading
Disabled
Long Labels
Dark Mode
Keyboard Focus
Accessibility
```

The current React Storybook (`packages/ui/src/primitives/Button.stories.tsx`)
covers Playground, All Variants, Pill, Sizes, Icon Only, With Icons (by
default size and by every size), Status States, Loading, and Disabled — Long
Labels, explicit Dark Mode, and Keyboard Focus stories are still gaps against
this requirement, not yet false claims corrected by this reconciliation.

## Testing

- activation by click, Enter, and Space
- disabled behavior
- loading behavior
- accessible name
- focus-visible behavior
- variant rendering
- size rendering
- icon alignment
- dark mode
- reduced motion
- visual regression

# 30. AI Action Button

## Status

This section predates any AI-specific Figma component and was aspirational
when written. On 2026-07-14, Figma published a real "AI Communication
Component Library" (node `760:1965`) and it was implemented as `AIButton`
(`packages/ui/src/primitives/AIButton.tsx`) — see §46 for the reconciled,
Figma-sourced specification. The Variants and States below do not match the
real component and are kept only as a historical record of the pre-Figma
design intent:

- Variants: Figma ships `Primary AI | Secondary AI | Tertiary AI | Outline
  AI`, not `Primary AI | Secondary AI | Ghost AI | Icon AI` — there is no
  "Ghost AI"; "Icon AI" is an `iconOnly` modifier in the real component
  (mirroring how Button's own Icon Only isn't a `variant`), not a variant.
- States: Figma's real AI Button models only the same interaction states
  as Button (Default/Hover/Active/Focus/Disabled/Loading, plus the same
  Success/Error/Warning status tint — see §5's Status subsection) — not an
  AI-process state machine (Idle/Generating/Streaming/Complete/Needs
  Review/Cancelled/Unavailable). Those AI-process states may still be the
  right model for a future AI *response* surface (see
  `docs/component-architecture.md` §8's `AIResponse`/`AIStatus` primitives,
  still unbuilt) — they just aren't what the Button-shaped trigger control
  implements.

## Purpose

AI Action Button initiates an explicit AI-assisted action while keeping the user in control.

## Examples

```text
Summarize
Draft
Rewrite
Fix Grammar
Explain Data
Generate Report
Extract Information
Auto-Triage
Next Best Action
```

## Requirements

- Clearly communicate that the action is AI-assisted.
- Provide generation status.
- Allow cancellation when operations are lengthy.
- Preserve user-authored content.
- Provide edit, accept, reject, regenerate, and undo where applicable.
- Avoid implying certainty when output is probabilistic.
- Use the AI visual treatment consistently and sparingly.

These requirements remain aspirational guidance for a future AI response
surface; §46 documents which of them the shipped `AIButton` trigger control
actually satisfies today.

# 31. AI Response Panel

## Purpose

AI Response Panel presents generated content, evidence, status, and human-review controls.

## Anatomy

```text
Header
AI status
Generated response
Sources or citations
Confidence or limitations
Feedback controls
Edit action
Accept action
Reject action
Regenerate action
```

## Requirements

- Identify generated content.
- Show sources where available.
- Support correction and human review.
- Preserve an audit trail for high-impact workflows.
- Clearly distinguish system content from user-authored content.
- Provide error and partial-result states.

---

# 32. AI Confidence Indicator

## Purpose

AI Confidence Indicator communicates model certainty only where the metric is meaningful and calibrated.

## Requirements

- Do not present arbitrary confidence values.
- Pair numeric confidence with explanatory language.
- Do not use color alone.
- Clarify whether confidence applies to a field, record, or complete response.
- Provide guidance for low-confidence outcomes.

---

# 33. File Upload

## Purpose

File Upload supports selecting, dropping, validating, and processing files.

## States

```text
Idle
Drag Active
Uploading
Processing
Complete
Warning
Error
Cancelled
```

## Requirements

- Support keyboard file selection.
- Communicate accepted formats and limits.
- Show per-file status when multiple files are uploaded.
- Provide retry and removal actions.
- Announce validation errors.
- Do not rely only on drag and drop.

---

# 34. Search Field

## Purpose

Search Field initiates or filters search results.

## Behavior models

```text
Submit search
Live filtering
Autocomplete
Command search
```

The selected model must be documented.

## Requirements

- Provide a visible or accessible label.
- Clear action must be accessible.
- Loading and no-results states must be supported.
- Debounce live search responsibly.
- Preserve user input during errors.

---

# 35. Menu and Dropdown

## Purpose

Menu presents a collection of actions. Dropdown is a general placement pattern and must use the correct internal semantics.

## Menu item types

```text
Action
Checkbox item
Radio item
Submenu
Separator
Label
```

## Requirements

- Use roving focus.
- Support Arrow keys, Enter, Space, Escape, Home, and End.
- Disabled items remain perceivable but not actionable.
- Do not use menu semantics for ordinary navigation lists without menu behavior.

---

# 36. Command Palette

## Purpose

Command Palette provides keyboard-first access to actions and destinations.

## Requirements

- Support search, grouping, and keyboard navigation.
- Clearly distinguish navigation from actions.
- Show shortcuts where available.
- Announce result count and active result.
- Preserve focus and return it on close.
- Support empty and loading states.

---

# 43. Split Button — 2026-07-14 expansion

`packages/ui/src/composite/SplitButton.tsx` (not previously given its own
numbered section in this document) grew past its original `lg`-only,
Primary/Raised/Secondary scope. Sourced from node `555:300` via
`get_design_context` on the sm/md size instances and the Outline type
instances.

## Sizes

```text
Sm (36px)
Md (40px)
Lg (48px, previous default, preserved as the component default)
```

## Variants

```text
Primary
Raised
Secondary
Outline   (new — reuses Secondary's border/text/divider tokens but shows
           the border at rest, using the new brand.border-strong token)
```

## Properties added

```text
size        enum: sm | md | lg (default lg)
iconStart   renderable content (icon), rendered before the label
```

## Known limitation

Figma's `sm` dropdown-toggle segment is a non-square 30px width against a
36px-tall container; 30px isn't on the approved spacing scale
(`docs/design-tokens.md` §4), so the shipped `sm` dropdown segment is
squared off to 36px (`--spacing-36`) instead of inventing a new token for
one edge case. Flagged for design-system review rather than silently
matched pixel-for-pixel.

## Change history

- 2026-07-14: added `size` (sm/md/lg) and the `outline` variant; added an
  optional `iconStart` slot. Source: Lumen-DS-2027 node `555:300`.

---

# 44. Filter Chip

## Status

Baseline specification, added 2026-07-14.

## Figma source

- Node: `581:409` ("Filter Chip", Buttons page)
- Component set: Filter Chip
- Last synchronized: 2026-07-14

## Purpose

A toggleable pill representing a filter that can be added to or removed
from an active filter set.

## When to use

- Faceted search and filtering UIs where a user builds up a set of active
  filters.

## When not to use

- A single, mutually-exclusive choice — use Choice Chip instead.
- A persistent on/off setting unrelated to filtering — use Switch.

## Anatomy

```text
Filter Chip
├── Leading icon (plus, unselected; retained when selected per Figma)
├── Label
├── Trailing icon (remove/X, selected only)
└── Focus ring
```

## Variants

None — Filter Chip has no `variant` property, only the `selected` state
below.

## Sizes

```text
Lg (36px) — the only size Figma specs.
```

## States

```text
Default
Hover
Selected
Hover+Selected
Focus
Disabled
```

`Pressed`/`Active` was not found as a distinct instance in the sourced
node; not implemented.

## Properties

Figma properties: `Label`, `State` (Default/Selected/Hover/Hover+Selected/
Focus/Disabled), `Size` (Lg only), `chipAddIcon` (instance swap),
`chipDeleteIcon` (instance swap, Selected only).

Property contract (framework-neutral):

```text
selected    boolean
disabled    boolean
icon        renderable content (icon), leading — defaults to the Figma-specced plus glyph
removeIcon  renderable content (icon), trailing, shown only when selected — defaults to an X glyph
```

## Reference implementation (React)

```ts
export interface FilterChipProps
  extends Omit<React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, "disabled"> {
  selected?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  removeIcon?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

Source: `packages/ui/src/primitives/FilterChip.tsx`.

## Behavior

- Clicking toggles the caller's `selected` state via `onClick` — the
  component is presentation-only and does not manage selection state
  itself (consistent with `onClick`-driven components elsewhere in this
  package, e.g. `SplitButton`).
- Disabled chips do not receive interaction.

## Content

Use short, scannable filter-category labels (e.g. "Status", "Owner").

## Tokens

```text
Color/Brand/Border-Strong  (new, primary.200 — unselected border)
Color/Brand/Default        (selected fill/border)
Color/Brand/Subtle         (unselected hover fill/border)
Color/Brand/Hover          (selected hover fill/border)
Radius/Full
Spacing/36 (height), Spacing/12, Spacing/16, Spacing/6 (gap)
```

## Accessibility

- Renders a native `<button>` with `aria-pressed` reflecting `selected`.
- Uses `aria-disabled` rather than the native `disabled` attribute,
  matching the Buttons page's "02 Accessibility & WCAG 2.1" guidance
  already followed by Button and SplitButton, so a disabled chip stays
  keyboard-reachable.
- Icons are `aria-hidden`; the accessible name comes from the label text.

## Storybook

`Primitives/FilterChip`: Playground, States (Default/Selected/Disabled),
Interactive (stateful toggle demo).

## Testing

`packages/ui/src/primitives/FilterChip.test.tsx`: default render, selected
aria-pressed, unselected aria-pressed, icon count by selection state,
onClick, disabled behavior, padding by selection state.

## Code mapping

| Framework | Export | Source |
|---|---|---|
| React | `FilterChip` | `packages/ui/src/primitives/FilterChip.tsx` |

## Known limitations

- Only the `lg` size is implemented — no other size is specced in Figma.
- `Pressed`/`Active` interaction state not found in the sourced Figma
  instances.

## Change history

- 2026-07-14: added, sourced from node `581:409`.

# 45. Choice Chip

## Status

Baseline specification, added 2026-07-14.

## Figma source

- Node: `581:485` ("Choice Chip", Buttons page)
- Component set: Choice Chip
- Last synchronized: 2026-07-14

## Purpose

A toggleable pill representing one value in a single-choice set (visually
similar to Filter Chip, semantically a selection rather than a filter
add/remove action).

## When to use

- A small set of mutually-exclusive options presented as pills rather than
  a Radio Group (e.g. size pickers, quick filters with a single active
  value).

## When not to use

- A multi-select, addable/removable filter — use Filter Chip.
- A large option set better served by Select or Radio Group.

## Anatomy

```text
Choice Chip
├── Leading icon (check, selected only)
├── Label
└── Focus ring
```

## Variants

None — no `variant` property, only the `selected` state below.

## Sizes

```text
Lg (36px) — the only size Figma specs.
```

## States

```text
Default
Selected
```

Hover/Focus/Disabled were not independently sourced for Choice Chip but
reuse the identical semantic tokens Filter Chip's corresponding states use
(`--button/border/secondary/default`, `--button/surface`, `--button/
surface/disabled`, etc. — confirmed identical token names across both
components' Default/Selected instances), so the same treatment is applied
in code. Flagged as inferred-by-consistency, not independently verified
per-state.

## Properties

Figma properties: `Label`, `State` (Default/Selected), `Size` (Lg only).

Property contract (framework-neutral):

```text
selected  boolean
disabled  boolean
```

## Reference implementation (React)

```ts
export interface ChoiceChipProps
  extends Omit<React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, "disabled"> {
  selected?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

Source: `packages/ui/src/primitives/ChoiceChip.tsx`.

## Behavior

- Clicking toggles the caller's `selected` state via `onClick` — same
  presentation-only pattern as Filter Chip.
- Disabled chips do not receive interaction.

## Content

Use short option labels (e.g. "Small", "Medium", "Large").

## Tokens

Same token set as Filter Chip (see §44) — Choice Chip's Default/Selected
instances bind identical variable names.

## Accessibility

Same pattern as Filter Chip: native `<button>` with `aria-pressed`,
`aria-disabled` instead of the native `disabled` attribute.

## Storybook

`Primitives/ChoiceChip`: Playground, States (Default/Selected/Disabled),
SingleChoiceGroup (stateful single-selection demo).

## Testing

`packages/ui/src/primitives/ChoiceChip.test.tsx`: default render (no
icon), selected render (check icon), aria-pressed, onClick, disabled
behavior.

## Code mapping

| Framework | Export | Source |
|---|---|---|
| React | `ChoiceChip` | `packages/ui/src/primitives/ChoiceChip.tsx` |

## Known limitations

- Only the `lg` size is implemented.
- Hover/Focus/Disabled states are inferred from Filter Chip's identical
  token usage, not independently sourced from Choice-Chip-specific Figma
  instances for every state.

## Change history

- 2026-07-14: added, sourced from node `581:485`.

# 46. AI Button

## Status

Baseline specification, added 2026-07-14. Supersedes the variant/state
lists in §30 "AI Action Button" (see that section's Status note) — §30's
purpose/examples/requirements prose remains the intent this component
serves; only its old, pre-Figma variant and state lists were wrong.

## Figma source

- Node: `760:1965` ("AI Communication Component Library", Buttons page)
- Component set: AI Button (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary/Outline AI, plus
  Icon-Only and Split Button AI sub-sections)
- Last synchronized: 2026-07-14

## Purpose

Initiates an explicit AI-assisted action while keeping the user in
control — see §30 for the full purpose/examples/requirements narrative
this component implements.

## When to use

- A single, explicit, user-initiated AI action (e.g. "Summarize", "Draft
  reply") — see the Capability Catalog story for the full set of example
  actions Figma documents, grouped by category.

## When not to use

- An implicit or automatic AI action the user didn't request.
- Presenting AI-generated output itself — use a future `AIResponsePanel`
  (still unbuilt, see `docs/component-architecture.md` §8).

## Anatomy

```text
AI Button
├── Leading icon (sparkle by default, swappable per capability — mandatory,
│   every Figma instance has one)
├── Label
├── Loading indicator (replaces the leading icon)
└── Focus ring
```

## Variants

```text
Primary
Secondary  (filled-tint look: brand-subtle fill + brand-border-strong
            border — NOT the same treatment as Button's own `secondary`)
Tertiary   (identical colors to Button's `tertiary`)
Outline    (brand-border-strong border, transparent fill — Button has no
            matching variant yet, see `docs/changelog.md` `[Unreleased]`)
```

## Modifiers

### Icon only

Square, label-less button showing just the leading icon. Documented in
Figma as its own "Icon Only" sub-section (Primary/Secondary/Outline, 3
sizes each) rather than a variant — modeled here as `iconOnly`, matching
Button's own Icon Only modifier pattern.

### Destructive

Behavioral only. Figma's "Destructive AI" instance uses the exact same
surface/border/text tokens as Secondary AI — there is no dedicated color.
Callers must add their own confirmation step before invoking `onClick`
when `destructive` is set; the prop documents intent for calling code and
sets `data-destructive` for hook-in, but changes no styling itself.

## Sizes

```text
Xs
Sm
Md
Lg
```

Reuses Button's sm/md/lg padding and text scale exactly. Figma's `xs` AI
Button is 28px tall — 4px shorter than Button's own 32px `xs` — not
matched exactly, to avoid introducing a second `xs` height scale for one
component; flagged as a known limitation.

## States

```text
Default
Hover
Pressed
Focus
Disabled
Loading
```

Plus the same Success/Warning/Error status tint documented in §5 — Figma's
State property lists Success/Error/Warning for the general Button
component-set, and the AI Button's own States sub-section under node
`760:1965` mirrors that same list on Primary Raised/Primary/Secondary/
Tertiary/Outline/Link columns. Not implemented on `AIButton` in this pass
— `status` was verified and shipped on Button (§5) but not re-verified
against AI-Button-specific instances; flagged as an open item rather than
assumed identical.

## Properties

Figma properties (per the AI Button instances on node `760:1965`):
`Type` (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary/Outline), `Size` (Xs/Sm/Md/Lg), `State`,
`Label`, an instance-swappable leading icon.

Property contract (framework-neutral):

```text
variant     enum: primary | secondary | tertiary | outline
size        enum: xs | sm | md | lg
icon        renderable content (icon) — always rendered; defaults to a sparkle glyph
iconOnly    boolean
loading     boolean
disabled    boolean
destructive boolean (behavioral only — no visual change)
```

## Reference implementation (React)

```ts
export interface AIButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary" | "outline";
  size?: "xs" | "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  isLoading?: boolean;
  iconOnly?: boolean;
  destructive?: boolean;
}
```

Source: `packages/ui/src/primitives/AIButton.tsx`. Not a variant of
`Button` — implemented as a standalone component because two of its four
`variant` values don't reuse Button's existing colors (see Variants
above).

## Behavior

- Same activation/loading/disabled behavior as Button (§5): pointer click,
  Enter, or Space; `aria-disabled` (not the native `disabled` attribute)
  so a disabled AI Button stays keyboard-reachable; loading preserves
  width and prevents duplicate activation.
- Loading swaps the leading icon for a spinner and is expected to pair
  with a label change (e.g. "Generating…") — confirmed via the Loading AI
  Figma instance, otherwise identical to Primary AI.
- Destructive AI actions require confirmation before running, same rule
  Button.tsx already documents for its own destructive actions (§5
  Behavior) — `destructive` only marks intent, the caller owns the
  confirmation UI.

## Content

Same content guidance as Button (§5) — concise, action-oriented labels,
verb-first where practical.

## Tokens

```text
Color/Brand/Default, Hover, Pressed          (primary variant)
Color/Brand/Subtle, Subtle-Pressed           (secondary/tertiary/outline fills)
Color/Brand/Border-Strong                    (secondary/outline border, new — see Split Button §43)
Radius/Md
Spacing/32,36,40,48 (heights), /8 (icon gap), /10,12,16,20 (padding)
```

No new tokens were required beyond `brand.border-strong`, already added
for Split Button's Outline type (§43).

## Accessibility

Same accessibility contract as Button (§5): native `<button>`,
`aria-disabled`, `aria-busy` while loading, mandatory `aria-label` for
icon-only instances (dev-mode console warning if omitted).

## Storybook

`Primitives/AIButton`: Playground, All Variants, Sizes, Icon Only, Custom
Icon, Loading, Destructive, Disabled, and a Capability Catalog composition
story (the category → example-action mapping from node `860:9109`, shown
as a story rather than a new `packages/patterns` pattern — see Known
limitations).

## Testing

`packages/ui/src/primitives/AIButton.test.tsx`: label + default icon
render, onClick, disabled behavior, loading aria-disabled/aria-busy,
loading blocks onClick, icon-only accessible-name warning, all four
variants render, destructive data-attribute, custom icon override.

## Code mapping

| Framework | Export | Source |
|---|---|---|
| React | `AIButton` | `packages/ui/src/primitives/AIButton.tsx` |

## Known limitations

- `status` (Success/Warning/Error) not implemented — see States above.
- `xs` size is 32px tall in code vs. Figma's 28px — see Sizes above.
- Split Button AI (a dropdown-toggle pairing analogous to `SplitButton`,
  documented under node `760:1965`) is not implemented — no shipped
  component composes `AIButton` with a dropdown segment yet.
- The Capability Catalog is shown only as a Storybook story, not shipped
  as a `packages/patterns` composition — it has no interaction behavior
  beyond the individual `AIButton`s themselves, so promoting it to a real
  pattern was deferred pending a concrete consumer need.

## Change history

- 2026-07-14: added, sourced from node `760:1965`.
