# Lumen Component Architecture

> Canonical component architecture for the **Lumen Design System**.  
> Figma is the design source of truth. React components, Storybook stories, tests, documentation, and published packages must mirror the approved Figma component model.

## Source

- **Figma file:** Lumen DS 2027
- **Dev Mode node:** `426:4395`
- **Reference:** https://www.figma.com/design/GJBYRm6ySR7XIECFcHMgy2/Lumen-DS-2027?node-id=426-4395&m=dev
- **Related specification:** `docs/design-tokens.md`
- **Last reviewed:** 2026-07-12

## Purpose

This document defines how Lumen components are structured, named, composed, implemented, tested, documented, synchronized, and released.

It exists to ensure that:

- Figma and code use the same component model
- components remain reusable and composable
- tokens are applied consistently
- Storybook reflects the current Figma library
- Claude Code performs incremental updates only
- component APIs remain stable and predictable
- enterprise-scale patterns do not become monolithic components

---

# 1. Architecture principles

Lumen components must follow these principles.

## 1.1 Figma is the source of truth

Figma owns:

- visual anatomy
- component variants
- component properties
- layout behavior
- spacing
- typography
- color roles
- radius
- elevation
- interactive states
- responsive intent
- usage guidance

Code must implement the approved Figma specification without introducing undocumented visual behavior.

## 1.2 Tokens before values

Components must consume approved tokens.

```text
Primitive tokens
    ↓
Semantic tokens
    ↓
Component tokens
    ↓
Component implementation
```

Do not hardcode colors, spacing, radius, typography, shadows, or motion when a token exists.

## 1.3 Composition before duplication

Build complex experiences by composing smaller components rather than duplicating markup or creating large all-purpose components.

## 1.4 Stable public APIs

A component’s public API must remain small, semantic, typed, and backward compatible.

## 1.5 Accessibility is part of the contract

Keyboard interaction, focus management, semantics, contrast, announcements, and reduced motion are implementation requirements, not optional enhancements.

## 1.6 Incremental synchronization

A Figma change should update only the affected component, token, story, test, and documentation files.

Never regenerate the entire design system for an incremental change.

---

# 2. Component hierarchy

Lumen uses five architectural levels.

```text
Foundations
    ↓
Primitives
    ↓
Composites
    ↓
Enterprise Components
    ↓
Patterns and Templates
```

## 2.1 Foundations

Foundations are system-wide decisions rather than UI components.

Examples:

- color
- typography
- spacing
- scale
- radius
- elevation
- borders
- opacity
- motion
- breakpoints
- iconography
- focus treatment
- grid and layout

Source:

```text
docs/design-tokens.md
```

## 2.2 Primitive components

Primitives are low-level reusable controls with minimal product-specific behavior.

Examples:

```text
Button
Icon Button
Link
Text
Heading
Icon
Badge
Avatar
Divider
Spinner
Progress
Skeleton
Tooltip
Checkbox
Radio
Switch
Input
Textarea
Select
```

Primitive components should:

- support controlled and uncontrolled usage where appropriate
- expose semantic props
- accept standard HTML attributes
- avoid product-specific business logic
- remain visually aligned with Figma variants

## 2.3 Composite components

Composite components combine primitives into reusable interaction units.

Examples:

```text
Form Field
Search Field
Password Field
Date Picker
Combobox
Menu
Dropdown
Tabs
Accordion
Breadcrumb
Pagination
Toast
Alert
Card
Dialog
Drawer
Popover
Table
Empty State
File Upload
```

Composite components should:

- compose primitives rather than reimplement them
- own internal interaction logic
- expose slots or structured subcomponents when necessary
- document required and optional children
- support keyboard and screen-reader behavior

## 2.4 Enterprise components

Enterprise components support complex data, workflow, administration, and AI use cases.

Examples:

```text
Data Grid
Filter Builder
Query Builder
Tree View
Command Palette
Bulk Action Bar
Activity Timeline
Audit Log
Workflow Stepper
Approval Panel
Permission Matrix
Data Visualization Container
AI Action Button
AI Response Panel
AI Confidence Indicator
AI Citation List
Human Review Queue
```

Enterprise components should:

- remain domain-neutral unless intentionally product-specific
- separate data logic from presentation
- support dense and comfortable display modes where required
- handle loading, empty, partial, error, and permission states
- support large datasets and performance constraints
- expose extension points rather than one-off variants

## 2.5 Patterns and templates

Patterns define how components work together to solve recurring experience problems.

Examples:

```text
Authentication
Search and Filter
Create and Edit Form
Master-Detail
Dashboard
Settings
Review and Approval
Bulk Operations
Import and Export
Error Recovery
AI-Assisted Drafting
Human-in-the-Loop Review
```

Templates must not be packaged as inflexible monolithic components unless repeated implementation proves that abstraction is justified.

---

# 3. Figma component model

Every production component in Figma should use a consistent structure.

## 3.1 Component set

Use a component set when a component has multiple supported variants or states.

Recommended variant dimensions:

```text
Variant
Size
State
Tone
Emphasis
Density
Orientation
Icon
Loading
Selected
```

Do not encode every Boolean combination as a variant when a component property can represent it more efficiently.

## 3.2 Component properties

Use Figma component properties for:

- text labels
- Boolean visibility
- instance swapping
- supported variant dimensions

Examples:

```text
Label
Show leading icon
Leading icon
Show trailing icon
Trailing icon
Loading
Disabled
```

## 3.3 Layer naming

Use predictable semantic names.

```text
Container
Content
Label
Supporting text
Leading icon
Trailing icon
State layer
Focus ring
Selection indicator
```

Avoid:

```text
Frame 123
Rectangle 4
Group 8
Text copy
```

## 3.4 Auto Layout

All production components should use Auto Layout unless a documented exception exists.

Required considerations:

- hug, fill, and fixed behavior
- minimum and maximum dimensions
- content growth
- text wrapping
- icon alignment
- nested spacing
- responsive resizing
- localization expansion

## 3.5 Variable bindings

Bind component properties to variables for:

- fill
- stroke
- text color
- spacing
- padding
- gap
- radius
- opacity
- size where supported

Production components should use semantic or component tokens rather than primitive values directly.

## 3.6 Component descriptions

Every published Figma component must include:

- purpose
- when to use
- when not to use
- variant guidance
- accessibility notes
- content guidance
- implementation mapping where available

---

# 4. Code architecture

Recommended repository structure:

```text
packages/
├── tokens/
│   ├── src/
│   └── dist/
│
├── components/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── primitives/
│   │   ├── composites/
│   │   ├── enterprise/
│   │   ├── patterns/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── utilities/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── tests/
│   └── package.json
│
├── icons/
│   ├── src/
│   └── package.json
│
└── storybook/
    ├── stories/
    ├── docs/
    └── .storybook/
```

Alternative component-local structure:

```text
button/
├── Button.tsx
├── Button.types.ts
├── Button.styles.ts
├── Button.test.tsx
├── Button.a11y.test.tsx
├── Button.stories.tsx
├── Button.mdx
└── index.ts
```

## 4.1 Component implementation layers

Each component should separate:

```text
Public API
Behavior
Presentation
Tokens
Tests
Documentation
```

Avoid mixing business logic into foundational components.

## 4.2 Public exports

Only supported public APIs should be exported from package entry points.

```ts
export { Button } from "./primitives/button";
export type { ButtonProps } from "./primitives/button";
```

Do not export internal implementation helpers unless they are intentionally public.

## 4.3 Styling

Components should use token-backed styles through the project’s approved styling approach.

Allowed:

- CSS custom properties
- token utilities
- Tailwind classes mapped to Lumen tokens
- component variants generated from a typed configuration

Avoid:

- arbitrary hex values
- arbitrary pixel values
- duplicated style strings
- inline visual values
- undocumented global CSS

---

# 5. Component API standards

## 5.1 Naming

Use PascalCase for React components.

```text
Button
IconButton
FormField
DataGrid
AIActionButton
```

Use camelCase for props.

```text
isLoading
leadingIcon
ariaLabel
onOpenChange
```

Prefer native terminology where possible:

```text
disabled
required
selected
checked
expanded
```

Avoid unnecessary prefixes such as `isDisabled` when the native prop is `disabled`.

## 5.2 Variants

Use semantic variant names.

Recommended:

```text
primary
secondary
tertiary
ghost
link
danger
ai
```

Avoid visual implementation names:

```text
blue
gray
outlinedBlue
filledDark
```

## 5.3 Sizes

Use a consistent size vocabulary:

```text
sm
md
lg
```

Add `xs` or `xl` only when approved by the design system.

## 5.4 Slots

Use slots for components with replaceable subregions.

Examples:

```text
leading
trailing
header
footer
actions
description
```

Do not expose excessive styling props for every internal layer.

## 5.5 Polymorphism

Support an `asChild` or equivalent pattern only when needed and tested.

Avoid unrestricted polymorphic APIs that weaken type safety or accessibility.

## 5.6 Controlled and uncontrolled state

Interactive composites should clearly document controlled and uncontrolled usage.

Examples:

```ts
open
defaultOpen
onOpenChange
```

Do not mix both models ambiguously.

---

# 6. Component state model

Each interactive component must define applicable states.

```text
Default
Hover
Pressed
Focus
Focus Visible
Disabled
Loading
Selected
Checked
Indeterminate
Expanded
Read Only
Invalid
Success
Warning
Error
```

Not every component needs every state. Unsupported combinations must not be exposed in Figma or code.

## State rules

- Disabled controls must not trigger actions.
- Loading controls must prevent duplicate activation where appropriate.
- Focus-visible treatment must use approved focus tokens.
- Error states must include text or semantic messaging, not color alone.
- Hover-only information must also be available through keyboard or touch interaction.
- Selected and pressed must not be visually ambiguous.

---

# 7. Button architecture

Button is a foundational primitive and must remain tightly governed.

## 7.1 Supported variants

```text
Primary
Secondary
Tertiary
Ghost
Link
Danger
AI
Icon
```

## 7.2 Supported sizes

```text
Sm
Md
Lg
```

## 7.3 Supported properties

```text
variant
size
disabled
loading
fullWidth
leadingIcon
trailingIcon
children
type
```

Icon-only buttons require an accessible name.

## 7.4 Anatomy

```text
Button
├── State layer
├── Content
│   ├── Leading icon
│   ├── Label
│   └── Trailing icon
├── Loading indicator
└── Focus ring
```

## 7.5 Suggested API

```tsx
<Button
  variant="primary"
  size="md"
  leadingIcon={<PlusIcon />}
  loading={false}
  disabled={false}
>
  Create project
</Button>
```

## 7.6 Button rules

- Use one primary action per logical region where possible.
- Do not use a disabled state to hide unavailable permissions without explanation.
- Loading must preserve button width.
- Icon-only buttons must provide `aria-label`.
- Link buttons must behave like links when navigation is intended.
- Danger buttons require clear destructive intent.
- AI buttons must communicate that the action is AI-assisted and preserve user control.

---

# 8. AI component architecture

Lumen is an AI-first design system. AI components must remain human-centered, transparent, and reversible.

## 8.1 AI primitives and composites

```text
AIActionButton
AISuggestion
AIResponse
AIConfidence
AICitation
AIFeedback
AIStatus
AIEditableOutput
AIReviewPanel
```

## 8.2 Required AI states

```text
Idle
Generating
Streaming
Complete
Needs review
Low confidence
Error
Unavailable
Cancelled
```

## 8.3 AI interaction requirements

AI components should support:

- clear system status
- source or evidence visibility
- confidence where meaningful
- edit and correction
- accept and reject
- regenerate
- undo
- cancellation
- feedback
- human review
- disclosure that content is AI-generated

Avoid decorative AI styling that does not communicate function.

---

# 9. Accessibility architecture

All components must meet WCAG 2.2 AA unless a stricter product requirement applies.

## Required checks

- semantic HTML
- accessible names
- keyboard navigation
- logical focus order
- visible focus
- contrast
- touch target size
- screen-reader announcements
- error association
- high zoom
- reflow
- reduced motion
- localization
- right-to-left support where required

## Headless behavior

For complex controls, use established accessible behavior primitives where appropriate. Visual styling must remain owned by Lumen tokens and component specifications.

## Accessibility ownership

Each component must document:

```text
Role
Accessible name
Keyboard interaction
Focus behavior
ARIA attributes
Announcements
Known constraints
```

---

# 10. Responsive and density architecture

Components should adapt through content and container behavior before introducing breakpoint-specific variants.

## Responsive rules

- avoid fixed widths unless required
- define minimum and maximum widths
- support text wrapping
- support localization expansion
- preserve touch targets
- use container-aware composition for complex components

## Density

Enterprise components may support:

```text
comfortable
compact
```

Density must be implemented through approved tokens, not arbitrary style overrides.

Do not add density variants to components that do not benefit from them.

---

# 11. Storybook architecture

Every production component requires Storybook coverage.

## Required stories

```text
Overview
All variants
All sizes
Interactive states
Loading
Disabled
With icons
Long content
Localization
Dark mode
Accessibility
Edge cases
```

## Story naming

```text
Components/Primitives/Button
Components/Composites/Form Field
Components/Enterprise/Data Grid
Patterns/AI Review
```

## Controls

Storybook controls should expose only supported public props.

Do not expose internal implementation details.

## Documentation

Each component page should include:

- purpose
- anatomy
- variants
- states
- usage
- accessibility
- content guidance
- token references
- Figma link
- implementation examples
- change history

## Visual regression

All stable variants and states should be included in visual regression coverage.

---

# 12. Testing architecture

Every component should include the relevant test layers.

## Unit tests

Validate:

- rendering
- props
- events
- state changes
- controlled and uncontrolled behavior

## Accessibility tests

Validate:

- automated accessibility rules
- accessible names
- keyboard navigation
- focus behavior
- ARIA state changes

## Visual tests

Validate:

- variants
- states
- themes
- density
- responsive layouts
- high-risk regressions

## Integration tests

Use for complex composites and patterns.

Examples:

- dialog focus management
- form validation
- data-grid selection
- menu keyboard behavior
- AI streaming and cancellation

---

# 13. Figma-to-code mapping

Each published Figma component should map to a code component where possible.

Recommended mapping record:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Figma component | Published component or component-set name |
| Node ID | Stable Figma node identifier |
| Code component | React export name |
| Source | Repository path |
| Storybook | Story path |
| Status | Mapped, partial, pending, deprecated |
| Last synchronized | Date or release |

Use Figma Code Connect for approved production mappings.

Example:

```text
Figma: Button
Code: Button
Source: packages/components/src/primitives/button/Button.tsx
Storybook: Components/Primitives/Button
```

Figma and code variant names should match unless a documented platform constraint requires an explicit mapping.

---

# 14. Component maturity model

Each component should carry a maturity status.

```text
Draft
Experimental
Beta
Stable
Deprecated
Removed
```

## Draft

- incomplete specification
- not published for product use

## Experimental

- available for evaluation
- API may change

## Beta

- usable with documented constraints
- requires feedback and additional validation

## Stable

- approved Figma and code implementation
- documented
- tested
- accessible
- versioned

## Deprecated

- still available temporarily
- replacement and migration guidance required

## Removed

- no longer exported
- major version change required when public API is affected

---

# 15. Change and release rules

Use semantic versioning.

## Patch

- defect correction
- accessibility fix
- documentation correction
- visual correction that does not change the public contract

## Minor

- new component
- new non-breaking variant
- new optional prop
- additive token support

## Major

- removed component
- renamed public prop
- changed default behavior
- incompatible visual or interaction contract

Every component change must update:

```text
docs/changelog.md
component source
tests
Storybook
documentation
Figma-to-code synchronization record
```

---

# 16. Deprecation policy

A deprecated component or prop must include:

- deprecation reason
- recommended replacement
- migration example
- target removal version
- Storybook warning
- TypeScript deprecation annotation where appropriate

Example:

```ts
/** @deprecated Use `variant="tertiary"` instead. */
quiet?: boolean;
```

Do not remove a stable public API without an approved major release.

---

# 17. Quality gates

A component is ready for release only when:

- [ ] Figma specification is approved.
- [ ] Figma component properties and variants are correctly structured.
- [ ] Component uses approved tokens.
- [ ] Public API is typed and reviewed.
- [ ] Unsupported variant combinations are prevented.
- [ ] Keyboard interaction is validated.
- [ ] Screen-reader behavior is validated.
- [ ] Focus treatment is visible.
- [ ] Light and dark modes are verified.
- [ ] Responsive behavior is verified.
- [ ] Localization expansion is tested.
- [ ] Unit tests pass.
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass.
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass.
- [ ] Storybook documentation is complete.
- [ ] Figma and code naming are synchronized.
- [ ] Changelog is updated.
- [ ] No unrelated components were modified.

---

# 18. Claude Code protocol

Before updating a component, Claude Code must read:

```text
AGENTS.md
docs/figma-source.md
docs/design-tokens.md
docs/component-architecture.md
docs/changelog.md
```

Then follow this workflow:

1. Identify the exact component changes listed in `changelog.md`.
2. Inspect the corresponding Figma component or approved specification.
3. Inspect the current code, stories, tests, and token dependencies.
4. Produce a concise impact summary.
5. Update only affected files.
6. Preserve existing APIs unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.
7. Run tests, accessibility checks, type checks, and Storybook build.
8. Report changed files and unresolved differences.
9. Do not regenerate or refactor unrelated components.
10. Do not invent missing Figma states, tokens, or behavior.

## Reusable Claude Code prompt

```markdown
Read:

- `docs/figma-source.md`
- `docs/design-tokens.md`
- `docs/component-architecture.md`
- `docs/changelog.md`

Treat the published Figma library as the source of truth.

Apply only the component changes documented in `changelog.md`.
Update only the affected component source, tokens, Storybook stories, tests, documentation, and exports.

Preserve the existing architecture, public API, naming conventions, and backward compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly approved.

Do not regenerate the design system.
Do not refactor unrelated components.
Do not invent missing Figma specifications.

Run type checks, tests, accessibility checks, and the Storybook build.
Then summarize:
1. files changed
2. behavior changed
3. validation results
4. unresolved Figma-to-code differences
```

---

# 20. Current source coverage

The supplied Figma node documents the Lumen foundation sections:

- Colors
- Typography
- Scale
- Spacing
- Radius

These foundations inform the component architecture described here.

The referenced node does not expose a complete component inventory or component-set property model. Therefore, component names, variants, APIs, and mappings in this document define the required architecture and governance model, but individual production components must be synchronized against their specific Figma component node URLs before implementation.
