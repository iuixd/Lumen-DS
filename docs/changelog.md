# Lumen Design Tokens Changelog

All notable changes to the **Lumen Design Tokens** are recorded in this file.

This changelog follows the principles of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and uses semantic versioning.

## Source

- **Figma file:** Lumen DS 2027
- **Dev Mode node:** `426:4395`
- **Reference:** https://www.figma.com/design/GJBYRm6ySR7XIECFcHMgy2/Lumen-DS-2027?node-id=426-4395&m=dev
- **Related documents:**
  - `docs/figma-source.md`
  - `docs/design-tokens.md`
  - `docs/component-architecture.md`

## Purpose

This file is the primary scope-control document for Claude Code.

Claude Code must:

1. Read the latest unreleased section first.
2. Apply only the changes explicitly listed there.
3. Update only affected tokens, components, Storybook stories, tests, documentation, and generated files.
4. Preserve all unrelated design-system files.
5. Never regenerate the entire Lumen Design System for an incremental update.
6. Report unresolved Figma-to-code differences instead of inventing values.

## Changelog conventions

Use the following headings for every release:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
### Changed

- Updated the Storybook manager branding and browser metadata.
  - Source: local Storybook manager; no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: the sidebar used a combined SVG wordmark on the gray app background, and browser tabs used Storybook's dynamic title and default favicon
  - Current: the sidebar uses a separate PNG brand mark with live `Lumen Design System` text on a white background; browser tabs use the Lumen title and PNG favicon
  - Affects: `packages/storybook/.storybook/manager.ts`, `packages/storybook/.storybook/manager-head.html`, `packages/storybook/public/Lumen-anim-logo-96.png`, and `packages/storybook/public/lumen-favicon.png`
  - Migration: none
  - Validation: lint, typecheck, 42 tests, token build, and production Storybook build passed; deployed Storybook verification pending
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed

- Fixed the Lumen logo URL in the published Storybook manager.
  - Source: production Storybook at `/Lumen-DS/`; no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: the logo and brand link used domain-root URLs, causing GitHub Pages to request `/lumen-ds-logo.svg` outside the repository deployment path
  - Current: the logo and brand link use relative URLs that resolve correctly for local Storybook and the `/Lumen-DS/` production base path
  - Affects: `packages/storybook/.storybook/manager.ts`, `packages/storybook/.storybook/main.ts`, and the Storybook navigation brand
  - Migration: none
  - Validation: lint, typecheck, and production Storybook build passed; generated manager bundle uses `./lumen-ds-logo.svg`; deployed URL verification pending
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)
### Migration
### Validation
```

### Versioning rules

- **Patch**: token correction, documentation fix, alias correction, or non-breaking accessibility fix
- **Minor**: new token, new semantic role, new mode, or additive component token
- **Major**: removed token, renamed public token, changed semantic meaning, or incompatible theme behavior

### Change-entry format

Each change should identify:

- affected token group
- Figma source or node
- old value or behavior
- new value or behavior
- affected code files
- affected components
- migration requirement
- validation status

Example:

```markdown
- Updated `Color/Action/Primary/Hover`
  - Figma source: Button color variables
  - Previous: alias to `Color/Blue/600`
  - Current: alias to `Color/Blue/700`
  - Affects: Button, Icon Button
  - Migration: none
  - Validation: Storybook visual test passed
```

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added the initial `design-tokens.md` specification for Lumen.
- Added the initial `component-architecture.md` specification.
- Added changelog governance for incremental Figma-to-code synchronization.
- Added documented enterprise token categories that require future implementation or verification:
  - border width
  - elevation
  - opacity
  - motion
  - z-index
  - breakpoints
  - control sizing
  - icon sizing
  - focus ring
- Added the required button token contract covering:
  - Primary
  - Secondary
  - Tertiary
  - Ghost
  - Link
  - Danger
  - AI
  - Icon
- Added required interaction states:
  - Default
  - Hover
  - Pressed
  - Focus
  - Disabled
  - Loading
- Added `Spacing/14` and `Spacing/18`
  - Figma source: Buttons page (node `475:7210`), the `Left`/`Right` icon-position instances added to Primary, Raised, Secondary, Tertiary, and Link
  - Value: 14px (Button size `xs`), 18px (Button sizes `md`/`lg`); 16px reused the existing `Spacing/16`
  - Affects: `@lumen/ui` `Button`'s `iconStart`/`iconEnd` icon sizing. No new `Button` variant or prop was needed — those props already reproduced the Left/Right instances' box model (6px gap, unchanged per-size padding) exactly; only the icon glyph's own size was undocumented.
  - Storybook: added `WithIcons` and `WithIconsBySize` stories to `Primitives/Button`
  - Migration: none
  - Validation: `tsc --noEmit` passed for `@lumen/ui`; `Button.test.tsx` (18 tests) passed; new stories confirmed registered and rendering via the running Storybook instance
  - Changeset: `.changeset/icon-position-buttons.md` (`@lumen/tokens` minor, `@lumen/ui` patch)
- Added `Color/Cobalt`, `Color/Japonica`, `Color/Deep Purple`, and `Color/Forest`
  - Figma source: Colors page (node `426:4396`), `get_variable_defs` Variables export (a later publish exposed the full color system; the initial read only returned a handful of neutral/brand-chrome variables)
  - Value: each a full 9-step `50`-`800` ramp, added as `cobalt`/`japonica`/`deep-purple`/`forest` in `packages/tokens/src/primitives/color.json`, matching the existing family step convention exactly
  - Affects: `@lumen/tokens` primitives only — no semantic alias, component, or Storybook usage added yet
  - Migration: none (purely additive)
  - Validation: `pnpm --filter @lumen/tokens build` regenerated `dist/css/variables.css`, `dist/tailwind-preset.cjs`, and `dist/index.ts` with all four families (36 new CSS variables each)
- Resolved the `Gray`/`Foundation` vs. `Neutral` and `Lumen Crimson` vs. `Primary` naming collisions flagged above
  - Figma source: Colors page (node `426:4396`), re-verified via `get_variable_defs`
  - Resolution: `Gray`, `Foundation`, and `Lumen Crimson` collections were retired in Figma. `Neutral` and `Primary` are canonical (per `docs/design-tokens.md` §16's selection criteria: already-shipped primitive/semantic names win over duplicate or brand-descriptive names with no functional benefit)
  - Affects: none — no code or token change required; the surviving `Neutral`/`Primary` Variables match `packages/tokens/src/primitives/color.json` exactly, step for step, with zero drift
  - Migration: none
  - Validation: re-queried `get_variable_defs` on node `426:4396` after the Figma fix; confirmed no `Gray`/`Foundation`/`Lumen Crimson` entries remain and every remaining value matches the existing primitive source

### Changed

- No confirmed token-value changes are recorded yet.
- Future updates must be added here before Claude Code modifies implementation files.
- Applied the Introduction page code typography and syntax text colors to all Storybook Docs code blocks.
  - Source: local Storybook Introduction page (`Introduction.mdx`); no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: the shared font and syntax-color selectors depended on `.docblock-source`, which did not guarantee coverage of every autogenerated story source wrapper
  - Current: all preformatted code inside `.sbdocs-wrapper` receives the same JetBrains Mono stack, base code color, and light/dark syntax-token colors
  - Affects: `packages/storybook/.storybook/tailwind.css`; MDX fenced examples and autogenerated source blocks across Primitives, Composite, Layout, and Patterns Docs pages
  - Migration: none
  - Validation: `corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/storybook build-storybook` passed
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)
- Updated textarea controls across Storybook Docs ArgsTables.
  - Source: local Storybook Docs control table; no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: Storybook applied a `1px` inset box shadow, a `200ms` box-shadow/opacity transition, and `6px` horizontal padding
  - Current: no box shadow or transition, `6px 16px` padding, `16px` radius, and `16px` font size
  - Affects: `packages/storybook/.storybook/tailwind.css`; textarea controls in all Storybook Docs pages
  - Migration: none; production Lumen form controls are unaffected
  - Validation: `corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/storybook build-storybook` passed
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)
- Applied the same Docs-only control treatment to text inputs and dropdowns.
  - Source: local Storybook Docs control table; no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: Storybook text inputs and selects retained their default inset shadow, transition, padding, and radius
  - Current: no box shadow or transition, `6px 16px` padding, `16px` radius, and `16px` font size
  - Affects: `packages/storybook/.storybook/tailwind.css`; text-input and native select controls in all Storybook Docs pages
  - Migration: none; boolean toggles and production Lumen controls are unaffected
  - Validation: `corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/storybook build-storybook` passed
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)
- Updated Storybook Docs ArgsTable type badges.
  - Source: local Storybook Docs control table; no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: type badges inherited the shared Docs body-small font size and Storybook text color
  - Current: `14px` font size and `rgba(46, 52, 56, 1)` text color
  - Affects: `packages/storybook/.storybook/tailwind.css`; type badges such as `string` and `boolean` across all Storybook Docs pages
  - Migration: none; inline code outside ArgsTables and production Lumen Badge components are unaffected
  - Validation: `corepack pnpm --filter @lumen/storybook build-storybook` passed
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)
- Added automated Storybook deployment from `main` to GitHub Pages.
  - Source: repository release workflow; no Figma node is involved
  - Previous: CI built Storybook but did not publish the static output
  - Current: `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml` builds Storybook, uploads the static artifact, and deploys it through the protected `github-pages` environment
  - Affects: GitHub Actions and the published Storybook only
  - Migration: repository administrators must select GitHub Actions as the Pages publishing source if it is not already enabled
  - Validation: local production Storybook build passed; remote deployment remains pending the first workflow run
  - Changeset: none (`@lumen/storybook` is private and no published package API changed)

### Deprecated

- None.

### Removed

- None.

### Fixed

- None.

### Migration

- None required for the initial documentation baseline.

### Validation

- The referenced Figma node was reviewed as the design-token foundation source.
- The visible sections include:
  - Colors
  - Typography
  - Scale
  - Spacing
  - Radius
- Exact Figma variable definitions could not be retrieved during this changelog creation because the Figma connector reported that no layer was selected.
- Exact color aliases, color mode values, font families, font weights, letter spacing, and scale values remain pending direct variable export or node-specific verification.

#### Color architecture

Added the required color-token architecture for:

- primitive palettes
- semantic backgrounds
- semantic text
- semantic icons
- semantic borders
- interactive action states
- Light mode
- Dark mode

Exact color values and aliases remain governed by the published Figma Variables library.

#### Governance

Added the following implementation rules:

- Figma is the canonical design source.
- Exported token files are the canonical machine-readable source.
- Components must not hardcode token-backed values.
- Semantic tokens should alias primitives.
- Component tokens should alias semantic or primitive tokens.
- Token removals and renames require migration documentation.
- Storybook token documentation must be generated from the same exported data used by components.

### Changed

- Established slash-separated token naming in Figma.
- Established kebab-case CSS custom-property naming in code.
- Established layered token architecture:
  - primitive
  - semantic
  - component

### Deprecated

- Direct primitive-color use inside production components is discouraged and should be migrated to semantic or component aliases.
- Arbitrary spacing and radius values outside the approved scale are discouraged.

### Removed

- None.

### Fixed

- None.

### Migration

For existing components:

1. Replace hardcoded colors with semantic or component tokens.
2. Replace arbitrary spacing with approved `Spacing/*` tokens.
3. Replace arbitrary radius values with approved `Radius/*` tokens.
4. Preserve current public APIs unless a breaking change is approved.
5. Update Storybook and visual tests only for affected components.

### Validation

Initial documentation validation completed for:

- spacing scale
- radius scale
- visible typography sizes and line heights
- token architecture
- naming rules
- incremental update workflow

Pending validation:

- exact color values
- color aliases
- Light and Dark mode mappings
- font families
- font weights
- letter spacing
- complete scale-token values
- elevation values
- motion values
- component-specific token mappings
