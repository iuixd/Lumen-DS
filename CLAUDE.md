# CLAUDE.md — Lumen Design System

This file governs how Claude Code (or any AI coding agent) should work
**inside this repository**. If you are building a product on top of this
design system, see `docs/claude-code-integration.md` for the snippet to add
to *your product repo's* CLAUDE.md instead.

## What this repo is

The single source of truth for Lumen's design tokens, UI components, layout
primitives, and enterprise patterns. Tokens are derived from the
`Lumen-DS-2027` Figma file (page "Design Tokens"); see `docs/figma-sync.md`
for exactly which nodes and what's still provisional. Published as three
packages:

- `@lumen/tokens` — color, typography, spacing, radius. No shadow/elevation
  tier (not defined in the current Figma source). Generated from JSON in
  `packages/tokens/src/*.json` via `packages/tokens/scripts/build.mjs`.
- `@lumen/ui` — React + TypeScript + Tailwind primitives, composite
  components, and layout primitives, all built on `@lumen/tokens`.
- `@lumen/patterns` — composed enterprise-SaaS screen patterns (CRUD list,
  settings, auth, dashboard) built entirely from `@lumen/ui`.

`packages/storybook` is the live showcase of all three — one page per
component with controls and auto-generated usage code, plus MDX pages for
the patterns. Run it with `pnpm storybook`. See "Component checklist" below.

## Hard rules when working in this repo

1. **Never hardcode a color, font size, spacing value, or shadow.** Every
   value must come from `@lumen/tokens` (a CSS variable, or the generated
   Tailwind theme key). If a value you need doesn't exist as a token, add it
   to the appropriate `packages/tokens/src/*.json` file and regenerate
   (`pnpm --filter @lumen/tokens build`) — don't inline it.
2. **Never add a component that duplicates an existing one.** Before adding
   anything to `packages/ui/src`, search `packages/ui/src/{primitives,composite,layout}`
   and `packages/patterns/src`. Extend an existing component with a new
   variant/prop before creating a new one.
3. **Match the Figma component taxonomy when one exists.** The current
   tokens-source Figma file has no linked component library, so
   `@lumen/ui`/`@lumen/patterns` are a generic rebuild, not matched 1:1
   against Figma component nodes — see `docs/figma-sync.md`. If a
   component-bearing Figma file is added back, reconcile naming/variants
   against it and keep new components named consistently so Code Connect
   mapping stays possible.
4. **Every new/changed component ships with:** a TypeScript-typed props
   interface, semantic-token-only styling, keyboard + screen-reader support
   (see `docs/accessibility.md`), a colocated Storybook story
   (`Component.stories.tsx`, `tags: ["autodocs"]`), and a Changeset
   (`pnpm changeset`).
5. **Don't publish silently.** Version bumps happen through the Changesets
   flow in `docs/versioning-and-releases.md`, not by hand-editing `package.json` versions.

## Working with Figma

Known gaps between the current Figma file and this repo (dark-theme
semantic colors, no shadow/elevation scale, icon set sourced from an
unrelated older library, no linked component library) are tracked in
`docs/figma-sync.md`. If you're asked to close one of these gaps, read that
file first — it lists exactly what's provisional vs. sourced.
